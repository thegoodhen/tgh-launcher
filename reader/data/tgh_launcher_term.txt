   QUICK GUIDE FOR MAINTAINERS
          · if necessary, describe supported Python versions via X-Python-Ver‐
            sion field in debian/control,

          · build-depend   on  python  or  python-all  or  python-all-dev  (>=
            2.6.6-3~),

          · build module/application using its standard build system, remember
            to  build  extensions for all supported Python versions (loop over
            pyversions -vr),

          · install files to the standard locations, add  --install-layout=deb
            to setup.py's install command if your package is using distutils,

          · add python2 to dh's --with option, or:

          · include       /usr/share/cdbs/1/class/python-distutils.mk       in
            debian/rules and depend on cdbs (>= 0.4.90), or:

          · call dh_python2 in the binary-* target,

          · add ${python:Depends} to Depends

   NOTES
       In order to support more than one Python version  in  the  same  binary
       package, dh_python2 (unlike dh_pycentral and dh_pysupport) creates sym‐
       links to all supported Python versions at build time

compose
Each file is specified as its

       the type is made by trying to match the file's extension with those  in
       the  mime.types  files.   If  the  encoding is omitted, it will also be
       determined from the file's extensions.  Currently  supported  encodings
       are  gzip  (.gz), bzip (.bz), bzip2 (.bz2), and compress (.Z).  A file‐
       name of "-" can be used to mean "standard input", but then a  mime-type
       must be specified.

       Both  the user's files (~/.mailcap; ~/.mime.types) and the system files
       (/etc/mailcap; /etc/mime.types) are searched in turn for information.

pon
pon
       pon,  invoked without arguments, runs the /etc/ppp/ppp_on_boot file, if
       it exists and is  executable.  Otherwise,  a  PPP  connection  will  be
       started  using configuration from /etc/ppp/peers/provider.  This is the
       default behaviour unless an isp-name argument is given.

       For instance, to use ISP configuration "myisp" run:

              pon myisp

       pon will then use the options file /etc/ppp/peers/myisp.  You can  pass
       additional  pppd  options  after the ISP name, too.  pon can be used to
       run multiple, simultaneous PPP connections.

       pon takes the following command line options:

              -q --quick
                     disconnect when ip-up finishes running.  This function is
                     only available to the root user.

   poff
       poff  closes  a PPP connection. If more than one PPP connection exists,
       the one named in the argument to poff will be killed, e.g.

              poff myprovider2

       will terminate the connection to myprovider2, and leave the PPP connec‐
       tions to e.g. "myprovider1" or "myprovider3" up and running.

       poff takes the following command line options:

              -r     causes the connection to be redialed after it is dropped.

              -d     toggles the state of pppd's debug option.

              -c     causes pppd(8) to renegotiate compression.

              -a     stops  all  running  ppp  connections.  If  the  argument
                     isp-name is given it will be ignored.

              -h     displays help information.

              -v     prints the version and exits.

              If no argument is given, poff will stop or signal  pppd  if  and
              only  if  there is exactly one running. If more than one connec‐
              tion is active, it will exit with an error code of 1.

   plog
       plog shows you the last few lines of  /var/log/ppp.log.  If  that  file
       doesn't  exist, it shows you the last few lines of your /var/log/syslog
       file, but excluding the lines not generated by pppd.  This script makes
       use  of the tail(1) command, so arguments that can be passed to tail(1)
       can also be passed to plog.

       Note: the plog script can only be used by root or another system admin‐
       istrator  in  group  "adm",  due to security reasons. Also, to have all
       pppd-generated information in one logfile, that plog can show, you need

HEAD
The request content for POST and PUT methods is read from
       stdin.  The content of the response is printed on stdout.  Error
       messages are printed on stderr.  The program returns a status value
       indicating the number of URLs that failed.

       The options are:

       -m <method>
           Set which method to use for the request.  If this option is not
           used, then the method is derived from the name of the program.

       -f  Force request through, even if the program believes that the method
           is illegal.  The server might reject the request eventually.

       -b <uri>
           This URI will be used as the base URI for resolving all relative
           URIs given as argument.

       -t <timeout>
           Set the timeout value for the requests.  The timeout is the amount
           of time that the program will wait for a response from the remote
           server before it fails.  The default unit for the timeout value is
           seconds.  You might append "m" or "h" to the timeout value to make
           it minutes or hours, respectively.  The default timeout is '3m',
           i.e. 3 minutes.

       -i <time>
           Set the If-Modified-Since header in the request. If time is the
           name of a file, use the modification timestamp for this file. If
           time is not a file, it is parsed as a literal date. Take a look at
           HTTP::Date for recognized formats.

       -c <content-type>
           Set the Content-Type for the request.  This option is only allowed
           for requests that take a content, i.e. POST and PUT.  You can force
           methods to take content by using the "-f" option together with
           "-c".  The default Content-Type for POST is
           "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".  The default Content-type for
           the others is "text/plain".

       -p <proxy-url>
           Set the proxy to be used for the requests.  The program also loads
           proxy settings from the environment.  You can disable this with the
           "-P" option.

       -P  Don't load proxy settings from environment.

       -H <header>
           Send this HTTP header with each request. You can specify several,
           e.g.:

               lwp-request \
                   -H 'Referer: http://other.url/' \
                   -H 'Host: somehost' \
                   http://this.url/

       -C <username>:<password>
           Provide credentials for documents that are protected by Basic
           Authentication.  If the document is protected and you did not
           specify the username and password with this option, then you will
           be prompted to provide these values.

       The following options controls what is displayed by the program:

       -u  Print request method and absolute URL as requests are made.

       -U  Print request headers in addition to request method and absolute
           URL.

strace
It  intercepts  and  records  the  system  calls  which are called by a
       process and the signals which are received by a process.  The  name  of
       each  system  call,  its  arguments and its return value are printed on
       standard error or to the file specified with the -o option.

       strace is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.  Sys‐
       tem  administrators,  diagnosticians  and trouble-shooters will find it
       invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the  source  is
       not  readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in order
       to trace them.  Students, hackers and the overly-curious will find that
       a  great  deal  can  be  learned about a system and its system calls by
       tracing even ordinary programs.  And programmers will find  that  since
       system  calls  and  signals  are  events that happen at the user/kernel
       interface, a close examination of this boundary is very useful for  bug
       isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

       Each  line  in the trace contains the system call name, followed by its
       arguments in parentheses and its return value.  An example from  strac‐
       ing the command ``cat /dev/null'' is:

       open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY) = 3

       Errors (typically a return value of -1) have the errno symbol and error
       string appended.

       open("/foo/bar", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

       Signals are printed as a signal symbol and a signal string.  An excerpt
       from stracing and interrupting the command ``sleep 666'' is:

       sigsuspend([] <unfinished ...>
       --- SIGINT (Interrupt) ---
       +++ killed by SIGINT +++

       If  a  system call is being executed and meanwhile another one is being
       called from a different thread/process then strace will try to preserve
       the  order  of  those  events and mark the ongoing call as being unfin‐
       ished.  When the call returns it will be marked as resumed.

       [pid 28772] select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL <unfinished ...>
       [pid 28779] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148, 939977000}) = 0
       [pid 28772] <... select resumed> )      = 1 (in [3])

       Interruption of a (restartable) system call by  a  signal  delivery  is
       processed  differently  as  kernel  terminates the system call and also
       arranges its immediate reexecution after the signal handler completes.

       read(0, 0x7ffff72cf5cf, 1)              = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
       --- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) @ 0 (0) ---
       rt_sigreturn(0xe)                       = 0
       read(0, ""..., 1)                       = 0

       Arguments are printed in symbolic form with a  passion.   This  example
       shows the shell performing ``>>xyzzy'' output redirection:

       open("xyzzy", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 3

       Here  the  third  argument of open is decoded by breaking down the flag
       argument into its three bitwise-OR constituents and printing  the  mode
       value in octal by tradition.  Where traditional or native usage differs
       from ANSI or POSIX, the latter forms are  preferred.   In  some  cases,
       strace output has proven to be more readable than the source.

       Structure  pointers  are  dereferenced and the members are displayed as
       appropriate.  In all cases arguments are formatted in the  most  C-like
       fashion  possible.   For  example,  the  essence of the command ``ls -l
       /dev/null'' is captured as:

       lstat("/dev/null", {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666, st_rdev=makedev(1, 3), ...}) = 0

       Notice how the `struct stat' argument is dereferenced and how each mem‐
       ber  is displayed symbolically.  In particular, observe how the st_mode
       member is carefully decoded into a bitwise-OR of symbolic  and  numeric
       values.   Also  notice in this example that the first argument to lstat
       is an input to the system call and the second argument  is  an  output.
       Since output arguments are not modified if the system call fails, argu‐
       ments may not always be dereferenced.  For example, retrying  the  ``ls
       -l'' example with a non-existent file produces the following line:

       lstat("/foo/bar", 0xb004) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

       In this case the porch light is on but nobody is home.

       Character  pointers  are  dereferenced  and printed as C strings.  Non-
       printing characters in strings are normally represented by  ordinary

             byte quantities of input data, in octal, per line.

     -s offset
             Skip offset bytes from the beginning of the input.  By default,
             offset is interpreted as a decimal number.  With a leading 0x or
             0X, offset is interpreted as a hexadecimal number, otherwise,
             with a leading 0, offset is interpreted as an octal number.
             Appending the character b, k, or m to offset causes it to be
             interpreted as a multiple of 512, 1024, or 1048576, respectively.

     -v      Cause hexdump to display all input data.  Without the -v option,
             any number of groups of output lines, which would be identical to
             the immediately preceding group of output lines (except for the
             input offsets), are replaced with a line comprised of a single
             asterisk.

     -x      Two-byte hexadecimal display.  Display the input offset in hexa‐
             decimal, followed by eight, space separated, four column, zero-
             filled, two-byte quantities of input data, in hexadecimal, per
             line.

     For each input file, hexdump sequentially copies the input to standard
     output, transforming the data according to the format strings specified
     by the -e and -f options, in the order that they were specified.

   Formats
     A format string contains any number of format units, separated by white‐
     space.  A format unit contains up to three items: an iteration count, a
     byte count, and a format.

     The iteration count is an optional positive integer, which defaults to
     one.  Each format is applied iteration count times.

     The byte count is an optional positive integer.  If specified it defines
     the number of bytes to be interpreted by each iteration of the format.

     If an iteration count and/or a byte count is specified, a single slash
     must be placed after the iteration count and/or before the byte count to
     disambiguate them.  Any whitespace before or after the slash is ignored.

     The format is required and must be surrounded by double quote (" ")
     marks.  It is interpreted as a fprintf-style format string (see
     fprintf(3)), with the following exceptions:

           ·   An asterisk (*) may not be used as a field width or precision.

           ·   A byte count or field precision is required for each ``s'' con‐
               version character (unlike the fprintf(3) default which prints
               the entire string if the precision is unspecified).

           ·   The conversion characters ``%'', ``h'', ``l'', ``n'', ``p'' and
               ``q'' are not supported.

           ·   The single character escape sequences described in the C stan‐
               dard are supported:

                     NUL                  \0
                     <alert character>    \a
                     <backspace>          \b
                     <form-feed>          \f
                     <newline>            \n
                     <carriage return>    \r
                     <tab>                \t
                     <vertical tab>       \v

     The hexdump utility also supports the following additional conversion
     strings:

     _a[dox]     Display the input offset, cumulative across input files, of
                 the next byte to be displayed.  The appended characters d, o,
                 and x specify the display base as decimal, octal or hexadeci‐
                 mal respectively.

     _A[dox]     Identical to the _a conversion string except that it is only
                 performed once, when all of the input data has been pro‐
                 cessed.

     _c          Output characters in the default character set.  Nonprinting
                 characters are displayed in three character, zero-padded
                 octal, except for those representable by standard escape
                 notation (see above), which are displayed as two character
                 strings.

     _p          Output characters in the default character set.  Nonprinting
                 characters are displayed as a single “.”.

     _u          Output US ASCII characters, with the exception that control
                 characters are displayed using the following, lower-case,
                 names.  Characters greater than 0xff, hexadecimal, are dis‐
                 played as hexadecimal strings.

scp
It uses ssh(1) for data
     transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security
     as ssh(1).  Unlike rcp(1), scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if
     they are needed for authentication.

     File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate that the
     file is to be copied to/from that host.  Local file names can be made
     explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file
     names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.  Copies between two remote hosts
     are also permitted.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      Forces scp to use protocol 1.

     -2      Forces scp to use protocol 2.

     -3      Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local
             host.  Without this option the data is copied directly between
             the two remote hosts.  Note that this option disables the
             progress meter.

     -4      Forces scp to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces scp to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -B      Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
             passphrases).

     -C      Compression enable.  Passes the -C flag to ssh(1) to enable com‐
             pression.

     -c cipher
             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
             option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -F ssh_config
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -i identity_file
             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public
             key authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
             ssh(1).

     -l limit

hostnamectl
This tool distinguishes three different host names: the high-level
       "pretty" hostname which might include all kinds of special characters
       (e.g. "Lennart's Laptop"), the static hostname which is used to
       initialize the kernel hostname at boot (e.g. "lennarts-laptop"), and
       the transient hostname which might be assigned temporarily due to
       network configuration and might revert back to the static hostname if
       network connectivity is lost and is only temporarily written to the
       kernel hostname (e.g. "dhcp-47-11").

       Note that the pretty hostname has little restrictions on the characters
       used, while the static and transient hostnames are limited to the
       usually accepted characters of internet domain names.

       The static host name is stored in /etc/hostname, see hostname(5) for
       more information. The pretty host name, chassis type and icon name are
       stored in /etc/machine-info, see machine-id(5).

       command line, in the form of a numerical day, month and year.

       If a format string is specified, the Discordian date will be printed in
       a format specified by the string. This mechanism works similarly to the
       format string mechanism of date(1), only almost completely differently.
       The fields are:

c_rehash
It then creates symbolic links for each of the
       files named by the hash value. This is useful as many programs require
       directories to be set up like this in order to find the certificates
       they require.

       If any directories are named on the command line then these directories
       are processed in turn. If not then and the environment variable
       SSL_CERT_DIR is defined then that is consulted. This variable should be
       a colon (:) separated list of directories, all of which will be
       processed. If neither of these conditions are true then
       /usr/lib/ssl/certs is processed.

       For each directory that is to be processed he user must have write
       permissions on the directory, if they do not then nothing will be
       printed for that directory.

       Note that this program deletes all the symbolic links that look like
       ones that it creates before processing a directory. Beware that if you
       run the program on a directory that contains symbolic links for other
       purposes that are named in the same format as those created by this
       program they will be lost.

       The hashes for certificate files are of the form <hash>.<n> where n is
       an integer. If the hash value already exists then n will be
       incremented, unless the file is a duplicate. Duplicates are detected
       using the fingerprint of the certificate. A warning will be printed if
       a duplicate is detected. The hashes for CRL files are of the form
       <hash>.r<n> and have the same behavior.

       The program will also warn if there are files with extension .pem which
       are not certificate or CRL files.

       The program uses the openssl program to compute the hashes and
       fingerprints. It expects the executable to be named openssl and be on

xsel
The  X server maintains three selections, called PRIMARY, SECONDARY and

       copying  and  pasting  via  the  middle mouse button. The SECONDARY and
       CLIPBOARD selections are less frequently used by application  programs.
       This  program operates on the PRIMARY selection unless otherwise speci‐
       fied.

       By default, this program outputs the selection without modification  if
       both  standard  input  and standard output are terminals (ttys). Other‐
       wise, the current selection is output if standard output is not a  ter‐
       minal  (tty),  and the selection is set from standard input if standard
       input is not a terminal (tty). If any input or output options are given
       then the program behaves only in the requested mode.

       If  both  input  and  output is required then the previous selection is
       output before being replaced by the contents of standard input.


       Input options

vim
It can be used
       to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful  for  editing
       programs.

       There  are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi win‐
       dows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line  editing,  filename
       completion,   on-line   help,   visual  selection,  etc..   See  ":help
       vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

       While running Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the  on-line  help
       system, with the ":help" command.  See the ON-LINE HELP section below.

       Most often Vim is started to edit a single file with the command

            vim file

       More generally Vim is started with:

            vim [options] [filelist]

       If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
       Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used  to  choose
       one or more files to be edited.

       file ..     A  list  of  filenames.   The first one will be the current
                   file and read into the buffer.  The cursor  will  be  posi‐
                   tioned on the first line of the buffer.  You can get to the
                   other files with the ":next" command.  To edit a file  that
                   starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "--".

       -           The  file  to  edit  is read from stdin.  Commands are read
                   from stderr, which should be a tty.

       -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on
                   a  "tag",  a sort of goto label.  {tag} is looked up in the
                   tags file, the associated file becomes the current file and
                   the  associated  command  is executed.  Mostly this is used
                   for C programs, in which case {tag}  could  be  a  function
                   name.  The effect is that the file containing that function
                   becomes the current file and the cursor  is  positioned  on
                   the start of the function.  See ":help tag-commands".

       -q [errorfile]
                   Start  in  quickFix mode.  The file [errorfile] is read and
                   the first error is displayed.  If [errorfile]  is  omitted,
                   the  filename  is  obtained  from  the  'errorfile'  option
                   (defaults to "AztecC.Err" for the  Amiga,  "errors.err"  on
                   other  systems).   Further errors can be jumped to with the
                   ":cn" command.  See ":help quickfix".

       Vim behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the exe‐
       cutable may still be the same file).

       vim       The "normal" way, everything is default.

       ex        Start  in Ex mode.  Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.
                 Can also be done with the "-e" argument.

       view      Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from  writing
                 the files.  Can also be done with the "-R" argument.

       gvim gview
                 The GUI version.  Starts a new window.  Can also be done with
                 the "-g" argument.

                 The GUI version in easy mode.  Starts a new window.  Can also
                 be done with the "-y" argument.

       rvim rview rgvim rgview
                 Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possi‐
                 ble to start shell commands, or suspend  Vim.   Can  also  be
                 done with the "-Z" argument.

xzcat
The native file format is the .xz
       format, but the legacy .lzma format used by LZMA  Utils  and  raw  com‐
       pressed streams with no container format headers are also supported.

       xz compresses or decompresses each file according to the selected oper‐
       ation mode.  If no files are given or file is -, xz reads from standard
       input and writes the processed data to standard output.  xz will refuse
       (display an error and skip the file) to write compressed data to  stan‐
       dard  output  if  it  is a terminal.  Similarly, xz will refuse to read
       compressed data from standard input if it is a terminal.

       Unless --stdout is specified, files other than - are written to  a  new
       file whose name is derived from the source file name:

       ·  When  compressing,  the  suffix  of  the  target file format (.xz or
          .lzma) is appended to the source filename to get  the  target  file‐
          name.

       ·  When  decompressing,  the  .xz  or  .lzma suffix is removed from the
          filename to get the target filename.  xz also  recognizes  the  suf‐
          fixes .txz and .tlz, and replaces them with the .tar suffix.

       If  the  target file already exists, an error is displayed and the file
       is skipped.

       Unless writing to standard output, xz will display a warning  and  skip
       the file if any of the following applies:

       ·  File  is  not  a regular file.  Symbolic links are not followed, and
          thus they are not considered to be regular files.

       ·  File has more than one hard link.

       ·  File has setuid, setgid, or sticky bit set.

       ·  The operation mode is set to compress and the  file  already  has  a
          suffix  of  the  target file format (.xz or .txz when compressing to
          the .xz format, and .lzma or .tlz when compressing to the .lzma for‐
          mat).

       ·  The  operation mode is set to decompress and the file doesn't have a
          suffix of any of the supported file formats (.xz,  .txz,  .lzma,  or
          .tlz).

       After successfully compressing or decompressing the file, xz copies the
       owner, group, permissions, access time, and modification time from  the
       source  file  to the target file.  If copying the group fails, the per‐
       missions are modified so that the target file doesn't become accessible
       to  users  who  didn't  have  permission to access the source file.  xz
       doesn't support copying other metadata like  access  control  lists  or
       extended attributes yet.

       Once  the  target file has been successfully closed, the source file is
       removed unless --keep was specified.  The source file is never  removed
       if the output is written to standard output.

       Sending  SIGINFO  or  SIGUSR1 to the xz process makes it print progress
       information to standard error.  This has only limited  use  since  when
       standard error is a terminal, using --verbose will display an automati‐
       cally updating progress indicator.

   Memory usage
       The memory usage of xz varies from a few hundred kilobytes  to  several
       gigabytes  depending  on  the  compression settings.  The settings used
       when compressing a file determine the memory requirements of the decom‐
       pressor.  Typically the decompressor needs 5 % to 20 % of the amount of
       memory that the compressor needed when creating the file.  For example,
       decompressing  a  file  created with xz -9 currently requires 65 MiB of
       memory.  Still, it is possible to have .xz files that  require  several
       gigabytes of memory to decompress.

       Especially  users  of  older  systems  may find the possibility of very
       large memory usage annoying.  To prevent  uncomfortable  surprises,  xz
       has  a  built-in  memory  usage  limiter, which is disabled by default.
       While some operating systems provide ways to limit the memory usage  of
       processes,  relying  on  it  wasn't  deemed to be flexible enough (e.g.
       using ulimit(1) to limit virtual memory tends to cripple mmap(2)).

       The memory usage limiter can be enabled with the  command  line  option
       --memlimit=limit.  Often it is more convenient to enable the limiter by
       default  by  setting  the  environment   variable   XZ_DEFAULTS,   e.g.
       XZ_DEFAULTS=--memlimit=150MiB.   It is possible to set the limits sepa‐
       rately for  compression  and  decompression  by  using  --memlimit-com‐
       press=limit  and  --memlimit-decompress=limit.  Using these two options
       outside XZ_DEFAULTS is rarely useful because a single run of xz  cannot
       do  both  compression  and  decompression  and  --memlimit=limit (or -

       tory, or pass in an explicit list of package  names.  When  documenting
       individual  source  files,  you  pass in a list of source (.java) file‐
       names. Examples are given at the end of this document. How Javadoc pro‐
       cesses source files is covered next.

   Processing of source files
       The  Javadoc  tool processes files that end in ".java" plus other files
       described under Source Files. If you run the Javadoc tool by explicitly
       passing in individual source filenames, you can determine exactly which
       ".java" files are processed. However, that is not how  most  developers
       want  to  work,  as it is simpler to pass in package names. The Javadoc
       tool can be run three ways without  explicitly  specifying  the  source
       filenames. You can (1) pass in package names, (2) use -subpackages, and
       (3) use wildcards with source filenames (*.java). In these  cases,  the
       Javadoc  tool  processes  a ".java" file only if it fulfills all of the
       following requirements:

          o Its name, after stripping off the ".java" suffix,  is  actually  a
            legal  class  name  (see the Java Language Specification for legal
            characters)

          o Its directory path relative to the root  of  the  source  tree  is
            actually  a legal package name (after converting its separators to
            dots)

          o Its package statement contains the legal package  name  (specified
            in the previous bullet)

       Processing of links - During a run, the Javadoc tool automatically adds
       cross-reference links to package, class and member names that are being
       documented as part of that run. Links appear in several places:

          o Declarations (return types, argument types, field types)

          o "See Also" sections generated from @see tags

          o In-line text generated from {@link} tags

          o Exception names generated from @throws tags

          o "Specified  by"  links  to  members  in interfaces and "Overrides"
            links to members in classes

          o Summary tables listing packages, classes and members

          o Package and class inheritance trees

          o The index

       You can add hyperlinks to existing text for classes not included on the
       command  line  (but  generated  separately)  by  way  of  the -link and
       -linkoffline options.

       Other processing details - The Javadoc tool produces one complete docu‐
       ment  each  time it is run; it cannot do incremental builds -- that is,
       it cannot modify or directly incorporate results from previous runs  of
       the  Javadoc  tool. However, it can link to results from other runs, as
       just mentioned.

       As implemented, the Javadoc tool requires and relies on the  java  com‐
       piler  to  do  its job. The Javadoc tool calls part of javac to compile
       the declarations, ignoring the member implementation. It builds a  rich
       internal  representation of the classes, including the class hierarchy,
       and "use" relationships, then generates the HTML from that. The Javadoc
       tool  also picks up user-supplied documentation from documentation com‐
       ments in the source code.

       In fact, the Javadoc tool will run on .java source files that are  pure
       stub  files  with no method bodies. This means you can write documenta‐
       tion comments and run the Javadoc tool in the earliest stages of design
       while creating the API, before writing the implementation.

       Relying  on  the  compiler  ensures  that  the  HTML output corresponds
       exactly with the actual implementation, which  may  rely  on  implicit,
       rather  than explicit, source code. For example, the Javadoc tool docu‐
       ments default constructors (see Java Language Specification)  that  are
       present in the .class files but not in the source code.

       In  many  cases,  the Javadoc tool allows you to generate documentation
       for source files whose code is incomplete or erroneous. This is a bene‐
       fit that enables you to generate documentation before all debugging and
       troubleshooting is done. For example, according to  the  Java  Language
       Specification,  a  class that contains an abstract method should itself
       be declared abstract. The Javadoc tool does not  check  for  this,  and
       would  proceed  without  a warning, whereas the javac compiler stops on
       this error. The Javadoc tool does do some  primitive  checking  of  doc
       comments.  Use the DocCheck doclet to check the doc comments more thor‐
       oughly.

       When the Javadoc tool builds its internal structure for the  documenta‐
       tion,  it  loads  all  referenced classes. Because of this, the Javadoc
       tool must be able to find all  referenced  classes,  whether  bootstrap
       classes, extensions, or user classes. For more about this, see How
       Classes Are Found @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/finding‐
       classes.html. Generally speaking, classes you create must either be
       loaded as an extension or in the Javadoc tool's class path.

   Javadoc Doclets
       You can customize the content and format of the Javadoc tool's output
       by using doclets. The Javadoc tool has a default "built-in" doclet,
       called the standard doclet, that generates HTML-formatted API documen‐
       tation. You can modify or subclass the standard doclet, or write your
       own doclet to generate HTML, XML, MIF, RTF or whatever output format
       you'd like. Information about doclets and their use is at the following
       locations:

            notes/guides/javadoc/index.html

          o The -doclet command-line option

       When a custom doclet is not specified with the -doclet command line
       option, the Javadoc tool will use the default standard doclet. The
       javadoc tool has several command line options that are available
       regardless of which doclet is being used. The standard doclet adds a
       supplementary set of command line options. Both sets of options are
       described below in the options section.

xprop
If  no
       formatting  information  is supplied, internal defaults are used.  If a
       property is not defined on the selected window or font,  "not  defined"
       is  printed  as  the  value  for that property.  If no property list is
       given, all the properties possessed by the selected window or font  are
       printed.

       A  window  may  be selected in one of four ways.  First, if the desired
       window is the root window, the -root argument  may  be  used.   If  the
       desired  window  is not the root window, it may be selected in two ways
       on the command line, either by id number such as might be obtained from
       xwininfo,  or by name if the window possesses a name.  The -id argument
       selects a window by id number in either decimal or hex (must start with
       0x) while the -name argument selects a window by name.

       The  last  way  to select a window does not involve the command line at
       all.  If none  of  -font,  -id,  -name,  and  -root  are  specified,  a
       crosshairs  cursor  is  displayed and the user is allowed to choose any
       visible window by pressing any pointer button in  the  desired  window.
       If  it  is desired to display properties of a font as opposed to a win‐
       dow, the -font argument must be used.

       Other than the above four arguments and the -help argument for  obtain‐
       ing  help,  and  the -grammar argument for listing the full grammar for
       the command line, all the other command  line  arguments  are  used  in
       specifying both the format of the properties to be displayed and how to
       display them.  The -len n argument specifies that at most  n  bytes  of
       any  given  property  will  be  read and displayed.  This is useful for
       example when displaying the cut buffer on the root window  which  could
       run to several pages if displayed in full.

       Normally each property name is displayed by printing first the property
       name then its type (if it has  one)  in  parentheses  followed  by  its
       value.   The  -notype argument specifies that property types should not
       be displayed.  The -fs argument is used to specify a file containing  a
       list of formats for properties while the -f argument is used to specify
       the format for one property.

       The formatting information for a  property  actually  consists  of  two
       parts, a format and a dformat.  The format specifies the actual format‐
       ting of the property (i.e., is it made up of words, bytes,  or  longs?,
       etc.) while the dformat specifies how the property should be displayed.

       The  following  paragraphs  describe how to construct formats and dfor‐
       mats.  However, for the vast majority of users and  uses,  this  should
       not be necessary as the built in defaults contain the formats and dfor‐
       mats necessary to display all the standard properties.  It should  only
       be necessary to specify formats and dformats if a new property is being
       dealt with or the user dislikes the standard display format.  New users
       especially are encouraged to skip this part.

       A  format  consists of one of 0, 8, 16, or 32 followed by a sequence of
       one or more format characters.  The 0, 8, 16, or 32 specifies how  many
       bits per field there are in the property.  Zero is a special case mean‐
       ing use the field size information associated with the property itself.
       (This is only needed for special cases like type INTEGER which is actu‐
       ally three different types depending on the size of the fields  of  the
       property.)

       A  value  of  8  means that the property is a sequence of bytes while a
       value of 16 would mean that the property is a sequence of  words.   The
       difference  between  these  two  lies  in the fact that the sequence of
       words will be byte swapped while the sequence of bytes will not be when
       read by a machine of the opposite byte order of the machine that origi‐
       nally wrote the property.  For more information on how  properties  are
       formatted and stored, consult the Xlib manual.

       Once  the  size  of  the  fields has been specified, it is necessary to
       specify the type of each field (i.e., is it an integer,  a  string,  an
       atom, or what?)  This is done using one format character per field.  If
       there are more fields in the property than format characters  supplied,
       the  last character will be repeated as many times as necessary for the
       extra fields.  The format characters and their meaning are as follows:

       a      The field holds an atom number.  A field of this type should  be
              of size 32.

       b      The  field  is  an boolean.  A 0 means false while anything else
              means true.

       c      The field is an unsigned number, a cardinal.

       i      The field is a signed integer.

       m      The field is a set of bit flags, 1 meaning on.

       o      The field is an array of icons, packed as a sequence of  32  bit
              numbers  consisting  of the width, height and ARGB pixel values,
              as defined for the _NET_WM_ICON property in the Extended  Window
              Manager  Hints  specification.   A field of this type must be of
              size 32.

       s      This field and the next ones until either a 0 or the end of  the
              property  represent  a sequence of bytes.  This format character
              is only usable with a field size of 8 and is most often used  to
              represent a string.

       t      This  field and the next ones until either a 0 or the end of the
              property represent an internationalized text string. This format
              character  is  only usable with a field size of 8. The string is
              assumed to be in an ICCCM compliant encoding and is converted to
              the current locale encoding before being output.

       u      This  field and the next ones until either a 0 or the end of the
              property represent an UTF-8 encoded unicode string. This  format
              character  is  only usable with a field size of 8. If the string
              is found to be an invalid character, the type of encoding viola‐
              tion  is printed instead, followed by the string formatted using
              's'. When in an environment  not  capable  of  displaying  UTF-8
              encoded string, behaviour is identical to 's'.

       x      The  field is a hex number (like 'c' but displayed in hex - most
              useful for displaying window ids and the like)

       An example format is 32ica which is the format for a property of  three
       fields  of 32 bits each, the first holding a signed integer, the second
       an unsigned integer, and the third an atom.

       The format of a dformat unlike that of a format is not so  rigid.   The
       only  limitations  on a dformat is that one may not start with a letter
       or a dash.  This is so that it can be  distinguished  from  a  property
       name  or  an  argument.   A dformat is a text string containing special
       characters instructing that various fields be printed at various points
       in a manner similar to the formatting string used by printf.  For exam‐
       ple, the dformat " is ( $0, $1 \)\n" would render the POINT 3, -4 which
       has a format of 32ii as " is ( 3, -4 )\n".

       Any  character  other  than  a  $,  ?, \, or a ( in a dformat prints as
       itself.  To print out one of $, ?, \, or ( precede  it  by  a  \.   For
       example, to print out a $, use \$.  Several special backslash sequences
       are provided as shortcuts.  \n will cause a  newline  to  be  displayed
       while \t will cause a tab to be displayed.  \o where o is an octal num‐
       ber will display character number o.

       A $ followed by a number n causes field number n to be displayed.   The
       format  of the displayed field depends on the formatting character used
       to describe it in the corresponding format.  I.e.,  if  a  cardinal  is
       described by 'c' it will print in decimal while if it is described by a
       'x' it is displayed in hex.

       If the field is not present in the property (this is possible with some
       properties), <field not available> is displayed instead.  $n+ will dis‐
       play field number n then a comma then field  number  n+1  then  another
       comma  then  ...  until  the  last  field  defined.   If field n is not
       defined, nothing is displayed.  This is useful for a property that is a
       list of values.

       A ? is used to start a conditional expression, a kind of if-then state‐
       ment.  ?exp(text) will display text if and only  if  exp  evaluates  to
       non-zero.   This  is useful for two things.  First, it allows fields to
       be displayed if and only if a flag is set.  And  second,  it  allows  a
       value  such  as a state number to be displayed as a name rather than as
       just a number.  The syntax of exp is as follows:

       exp    ::= term | term=exp | !exp

       term   ::= n | $n | mn

       The ! operator is a logical ``not'', changing 0 to 1 and  any  non-zero
       value  to  0.   =  is  an  equality operator.  Note that internally all
       expressions are evaluated as 32 bit numbers  so  -1  is  not  equal  to
       65535.  = returns 1 if the two values are equal and 0 if not.  n repre‐
       sents the constant value n while $n represents the value of field  num‐
       ber n.  mn is 1 if flag number n in the first field having format char‐
       acter 'm' in the corresponding format is 1, 0 otherwise.

       Examples: ?m3(count: $3\n) displays field 3 with a label  of  count  if
       and   only   if   flag   number   3   (count   starts  at  0!)  is  on.
       ?$2=0(True)?!$2=0(False) displays the inverted value of field  2  as  a
       boolean.

       In  order  to display a property, xprop needs both a format and a dfor‐
       mat.  Before xprop uses its default values of a format  of  32x  and  a
       dformat  of " = { $0+ }\n", it searches several places in an attempt to
       find more specific formats.  First, a search is made using the name  of
       the  property.   If  this fails, a search is made using the type of the
       property.  This allows type STRING to be defined with one set  of  for‐
       mats  while  allowing  property  WM_NAME  which is of type STRING to be
       defined with a different format.  In this way, the display formats  for
       a given type can be overridden for specific properties.

       The  locations  searched are in order: the format if any specified with
       the property name (as in 8x WM_NAME), the formats defined by -f options
       in  last  to first order, the contents of the file specified by the -fs
       option if any, the contents of the file specified by the  environmental
       variable XPROPFORMATS if any, and finally xprop's built in file of for‐
       mats.

       The format of the files referred to by the -fs argument and the  XPROP‐
       FORMATS variable is one or more lines of the following form:

       name format [dformat]

       Where name is either the name of a property or the name of a type, for‐
       mat is the format to be used with name and dformat is the dformat to be
       used with name.  If dformat is not present, " = $0+\n" is assumed.

xkbcomp
The most common use  for  xkbcomp
       is  to create a compiled keymap file (.xkm extension) which can be read
       directly by XKB-capable X servers or utilities.   The  keymap  compiler
       can  also  produce  C  header  files or XKB source files.  The C header
       files produced by xkbcomp can be included by  X  servers  or  utilities
       that  need a built-in default keymap.  The XKB source files produced by
       xkbcomp are fully resolved and can be used to  verify  that  the  files
       which typically make up an XKB keymap are merged correctly or to create
       a single file which contains a complete description of the keymap.

       The source may specify an X display, or an .xkb or .xkm  file;   unless
       explicitly  specified,  the format of destination depends on the format
       of the source.   Compiling a .xkb (keymap source) file generates a .xkm
       (compiled keymap file) by default.   If the source is a .xkm file or an
       X display, xkbcomp generates a keymap source file by default.

       If the destination is an X display,  the  keymap  for  the  display  is
       updated with the compiled keymap.

       The  name  of  the destination is usually computed from the name of the
       source, with the extension replaced as appropriate.  When  compiling  a
       single  map from a file which contains several maps, xkbcomp constructs
       the destination file name by appending an appropriate extension to  the
       name of the map to be used.

       package.  If name contains a '/', it is used as the path  to  a  Python
       source file to document. If name is 'keywords', 'topics', or 'modules',
       a listing of these things is displayed.

       pydoc3.4 -k keyword Search for a keyword in the synopsis lines  of  all
       available modules.

       pydoc3.4  -p  port  Start an HTTP server on the given port on the local
       machine.

       pydoc3.4 -g Pop up a graphical interface for finding and serving  docu‐
       mentation.

       pydoc3.4  -w  name [...]  Write out the HTML documentation for a module
       to a file in the current directory.  If name  contains  a  '/',  it  is
       treated  as a filename; if it names a directory, documentation is writ‐
       ten for all the contents.

from
The following options are available:

     -c      Just print a count of messages and exit.

     -f file
             The supplied file is examined instead of the invoker's mailbox.
             If the -f option is used, the user argument should not be used.
             Read from standard input if file name “-” is given.

     -s sender
             Only mail from addresses containing the supplied string are
             printed.

     If user is given, the user's mailbox is examined instead of the invoker's
     own mailbox.  (Privileges are required.)


>>>END
>>>BEGIN
cmp
The optional SKIP1 and SKIP2 specify the number of bytes to skip at the
       beginning of each file (zero by default).

       Mandatory arguments to long options are  mandatory  for  short  options
       too.

       -b, --print-bytes
              print differing bytes

jhat
jhat enables you to browse heap dumps using your  favorite  webbrowser.
       jhat  supports  pre-designed  queries (such as 'show all instances of a
       known class "Foo"') as well as OQL (Object Query Language) - a SQL-like
       query  language  to query heap dumps. Help on OQL is available from the
       OQL help page shown by jhat. With the default port, OQL help is  avail‐
       able at http://localhost:7000/oqlhelp/

       There are several ways to generate a java heap dump:

          o Use jmap(1) -dump option to obtain a heap dump at runtime;

          o Use jconsole(1) option to obtain a heap dump via HotSpotDiagnos‐
            ticMXBean @
            http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jre/api/management/exten‐
            sion/com/sun/management/HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean.html at runtime;

>>>BEGIN
GET
The request content for POST and PUT methods is read from
       stdin.  The content of the response is printed on stdout.  Error
       messages are printed on stderr.  The program returns a status value
       indicating the number of URLs that failed.

       The options are:

       -m <method>
           Set which method to use for the request.  If this option is not
           used, then the method is derived from the name of the program.

       -f  Force request through, even if the program believes that the method
           is illegal.  The server might reject the request eventually.

       -b <uri>
           This URI will be used as the base URI for resolving all relative
           URIs given as argument.

       -t <timeout>
           Set the timeout value for the requests.  The timeout is the amount
           of time that the program will wait for a response from the remote
           server before it fails.  The default unit for the timeout value is
           seconds.  You might append "m" or "h" to the timeout value to make
           it minutes or hours, respectively.  The default timeout is '3m',
           i.e. 3 minutes.

       -i <time>
           Set the If-Modified-Since header in the request. If time is the
           name of a file, use the modification timestamp for this file. If
           time is not a file, it is parsed as a literal date. Take a look at
           HTTP::Date for recognized formats.

       -c <content-type>
           Set the Content-Type for the request.  This option is only allowed
           for requests that take a content, i.e. POST and PUT.  You can force
           methods to take content by using the "-f" option together with
           "-c".  The default Content-Type for POST is
           "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".  The default Content-type for
           the others is "text/plain".

       -p <proxy-url>
           Set the proxy to be used for the requests.  The program also loads
           proxy settings from the environment.  You can disable this with the
           "-P" option.

       -P  Don't load proxy settings from environment.

       -H <header>
           Send this HTTP header with each request. You can specify several,
           e.g.:

               lwp-request \
                   -H 'Referer: http://other.url/' \
                   -H 'Host: somehost' \
                   http://this.url/

       -C <username>:<password>
           Provide credentials for documents that are protected by Basic
           Authentication.  If the document is protected and you did not
           specify the username and password with this option, then you will
           be prompted to provide these values.

       The following options controls what is displayed by the program:

       -u  Print request method and absolute URL as requests are made.

       -U  Print request headers in addition to request method and absolute
           URL.

       -s  Print response status code.  This option is always on for

           icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]


       If  pstree  is called as pstree.x11 then it will prompt the user at the
       end of the line to press return and will not return until that has hap‐
       pened.  This is useful for when pstree is run in a xterminal.

       Certain  kernel  or  mount  parameters,  such as the hidepid option for
       procfs, will hide information for some processes. In  these  situations
       pstree will attempt to build the tree without this information, showing

x86_64-linux-gnu-cpp-4.8
It is called a macro processor because it allows you to
       define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.

       The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and
       Objective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a general
       text processor.  It will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical
       rules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning
       of character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it
       preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to
       C-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs
       will be removed, and the Makefile will not work.

       Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which
       are not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe
       (Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.  -traditional-cpp

       Many of the problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments
       instead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.

       Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language
       you are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro
       facilities.  Most high level programming languages have their own
       conditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails,

The options are as follows:

     -b      One-byte octal display.  Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
             followed by sixteen space-separated, three column, zero-filled,
             bytes of input data, in octal, per line.

     -c      One-byte character display.  Display the input offset in hexadec‐
             imal, followed by sixteen space-separated, three column, space-
             filled, characters of input data per line.

     -C      Canonical hex+ASCII display.  Display the input offset in hexa‐
             decimal, followed by sixteen space-separated, two column, hexa‐
             decimal bytes, followed by the same sixteen bytes in %_p format
             enclosed in ``|'' characters.

             Calling the command hd implies this option.

     -d      Two-byte decimal display.  Display the input offset in hexadeci‐
             mal, followed by eight space-separated, five column, zero-filled,
             two-byte units of input data, in unsigned decimal, per line.

     -e format_string
             Specify a format string to be used for displaying data.

     -f format_file
             Specify a file that contains one or more newline separated format
             strings.  Empty lines and lines whose first non-blank character
             is a hash mark (#) are ignored.

     -n length
             Interpret only length bytes of input.

     -o      Two-byte octal display.  Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
             followed by eight space-separated, six column, zero-filled, two
             byte quantities of input data, in octal, per line.

     -s offset
             Skip offset bytes from the beginning of the input.  By default,
             offset is interpreted as a decimal number.  With a leading 0x or
             0X, offset is interpreted as a hexadecimal number, otherwise,
             with a leading 0, offset is interpreted as an octal number.
             Appending the character b, k, or m to offset causes it to be
             interpreted as a multiple of 512, 1024, or 1048576, respectively.

     -v      Cause hexdump to display all input data.  Without the -v option,
             any number of groups of output lines, which would be identical to
             the immediately preceding group of output lines (except for the
             input offsets), are replaced with a line comprised of a single
             asterisk.

     -x      Two-byte hexadecimal display.  Display the input offset in hexa‐
             decimal, followed by eight, space separated, four column, zero-
             filled, two-byte quantities of input data, in hexadecimal, per
             line.

     For each input file, hexdump sequentially copies the input to standard
     output, transforming the data according to the format strings specified
     by the -e and -f options, in the order that they were specified.

   Formats
     A format string contains any number of format units, separated by white‐
     space.  A format unit contains up to three items: an iteration count, a
     byte count, and a format.

     The iteration count is an optional positive integer, which defaults to
     one.  Each format is applied iteration count times.

     The byte count is an optional positive integer.  If specified it defines
     the number of bytes to be interpreted by each iteration of the format.

     If an iteration count and/or a byte count is specified, a single slash
     must be placed after the iteration count and/or before the byte count to
     disambiguate them.  Any whitespace before or after the slash is ignored.

     The format is required and must be surrounded by double quote (" ")
     marks.  It is interpreted as a fprintf-style format string (see
     fprintf(3)), with the following exceptions:

           ·   An asterisk (*) may not be used as a field width or precision.

           ·   A byte count or field precision is required for each ``s'' con‐
               version character (unlike the fprintf(3) default which prints
               the entire string if the precision is unspecified).

           ·   The conversion characters ``%'', ``h'', ``l'', ``n'', ``p'' and
               ``q'' are not supported.

           ·   The single character escape sequences described in the C stan‐
               dard are supported:

                     NUL                  \0
                     <alert character>    \a
                     <backspace>          \b
                     <form-feed>          \f
                     <newline>            \n
                     <carriage return>    \r
                     <tab>                \t
                     <vertical tab>       \v

     The hexdump utility also supports the following additional conversion
     strings:

     _a[dox]     Display the input offset, cumulative across input files, of
                 the next byte to be displayed.  The appended characters d, o,
                 and x specify the display base as decimal, octal or hexadeci‐
                 mal respectively.

     _A[dox]     Identical to the _a conversion string except that it is only
                 performed once, when all of the input data has been pro‐
                 cessed.

     _c          Output characters in the default character set.  Nonprinting
                 characters are displayed in three character, zero-padded
                 octal, except for those representable by standard escape
                 notation (see above), which are displayed as two character
                 strings.

     _p          Output characters in the default character set.  Nonprinting
                 characters are displayed as a single “.”.

     _u          Output US ASCII characters, with the exception that control
                 characters are displayed using the following, lower-case,
                 names.  Characters greater than 0xff, hexadecimal, are dis‐
                 played as hexadecimal strings.

       System load averages is the average number of processes that are either

       The  averages  are  taken over the three time intervals.  Load averages
       are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so a load  aver‐
       age  of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4
       CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the time.

rsync
It
       can  copy  locally,  to/from  another  host  over  any remote shell, or

       that  control  every  aspect  of  its behavior and permit very flexible
       specification of the set of files to be copied.  It is famous  for  its
       delta-transfer  algorithm,  which  reduces the amount of data sent over
       the network by sending only the differences between  the  source  files
       and  the  existing  files in the destination.  Rsync is widely used for
       backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.

       Rsync finds files that need to be transferred  using  a  "quick  check"
       algorithm  (by  default) that looks for files that have changed in size
       or  in  last-modified  time.   Any  changes  in  the  other   preserved
       attributes  (as  requested by options) are made on the destination file
       directly when the quick check indicates that the file’s data  does  not
       need to be updated.

       Some of the additional features of rsync are:

       o      support  for copying links, devices, owners, groups, and permis‐
              sions

       o      exclude and exclude-from options similar to GNU tar

rmid
The activation  sys‐
       tem  daemon  must  be  started before activatable objects can be either
       registered with the activation system or activated in a VM. See the
       Java RMI Specification @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/platform/rmi/spec/rmiTOC.html and
       Activation tutorials @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/activa‐
       tion/overview.html for details on how to write programs that use acti‐
       vatable remote objects.

       The daemon can be started by executing the rmid command, and specifying
       a security policy file, as follows:

           rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy


       Note: When running Sun's implementation of rmid, by default you will
       need to specify a security policy file so that rmid can verify whether
       or not the information in each ActivationGroupDesc is allowed to be
       used to launch a VM for an activation group. Specifically, the command
       and options specified by the CommandEnvironment and any Properties
       passed to an ActivationGroupDesc's constructor must now be explicitly
       allowed in the security policy file for rmid. The value of the
       sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy property dictates the policy that rmid
       uses to determine whether or not the information in an Activation‐
       GroupDesc may be used to launch a VM for an activation group.

       Executing rmid by default

          o starts the Activator and an internal registry on the default port,
            1098, and

          o binds an ActivationSystem to the name java.rmi.activation.Activa‐
            tionSystem in this internal registry.


       To specify an alternate port for the registry, you must specify the
       -port option when starting up rmid. For example,

           rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy -port 1099


       starts the activation system daemon and a registry on the registry's
       default port, 1099.

   Starting rmid from inetd/xinetd
       An alternative to starting rmid from the command line is to configure
       inetd (Solaris) or xinetd (Linux) to start rmid on demand.

       When rmid starts up, it attempts to obtain an inherited channel (inher‐
       ited from inetd/xinetd) by invoking the System.inheritedChannel method.
       If the inherited channel is null or not an instance of java.nio.chan‐
       nels.ServerSocketChannel, then rmid assumes that it was not started by
       inetd/xinetd, and it starts up as described above.

       If the inherited channel is a ServerSocketChannel instance, then rmid
       uses the java.net.ServerSocket obtained from the ServerSocketChannel as
       the server socket that accepts requests for the remote objects it
       exports, namely the registry in which the java.rmi.activation.Activa‐
       tionSystem is bound and the java.rmi.activation.Activator remote
       object. In this mode, rmid behaves the same as when it is started from
       the command line, except:

          o Output printed to System.err is redirected to a file. This file is
            located in the directory specified by the java.io.tmpdir system
            property (typically /var/tmp or /tmp) with the prefix "rmid-err"
            and the suffix "tmp".

The resulting code is typically faster than

       "paths" are a set of paths where find2perl will start its searches and

       "! PREDICATE"
           Negate the sense of the following predicate.  The "!" must be
           passed as a distinct argument, so it may need to be surrounded by
           whitespace and/or quoted from interpretation by the shell using a
           backslash (just as with using find(1)).

       "( PREDICATES )"
           Group the given PREDICATES.  The parentheses must be passed as
           distinct arguments, so they may need to be surrounded by whitespace
           and/or quoted from interpretation by the shell using a backslash
           (just as with using find(1)).

       "PREDICATE1 PREDICATE2"
           True if _both_ PREDICATE1 and PREDICATE2 are true; PREDICATE2 is
           not evaluated if PREDICATE1 is false.

       "PREDICATE1 -o PREDICATE2"
           True if either one of PREDICATE1 or PREDICATE2 is true; PREDICATE2
           is not evaluated if PREDICATE1 is true.

       "-follow"
           Follow (dereference) symlinks.  The checking of file attributes
           depends on the position of the "-follow" option. If it precedes the
           file check option, an "stat" is done which means the file check
           applies to the file the symbolic link is pointing to. If "-follow"
           option follows the file check option, this now applies to the
           symbolic link itself, i.e.  an "lstat" is done.

       "-depth"
           Change directory traversal algorithm from breadth-first to depth-
           first.

       "-prune"
           Do not descend into the directory currently matched.

       "-xdev"
           Do not traverse mount points (prunes search at mount-point
           directories).

       "-name GLOB"
           File name matches specified GLOB wildcard pattern.  GLOB may need
           to be quoted to avoid interpretation by the shell (just as with
           using find(1)).

       "-iname GLOB"
           Like "-name", but the match is case insensitive.

       "-path GLOB"
           Path name matches specified GLOB wildcard pattern.

       "-ipath GLOB"

lzcat
The native file format is the .xz
       format, but the legacy .lzma format used by LZMA  Utils  and  raw  com‐
       pressed streams with no container format headers are also supported.

       xz compresses or decompresses each file according to the selected oper‐
       ation mode.  If no files are given or file is -, xz reads from standard
       input and writes the processed data to standard output.  xz will refuse
       (display an error and skip the file) to write compressed data to  stan‐
       dard  output  if  it  is a terminal.  Similarly, xz will refuse to read
       compressed data from standard input if it is a terminal.

       Unless --stdout is specified, files other than - are written to  a  new
       file whose name is derived from the source file name:

       ·  When  compressing,  the  suffix  of  the  target file format (.xz or
          .lzma) is appended to the source filename to get  the  target  file‐
          name.

       ·  When  decompressing,  the  .xz  or  .lzma suffix is removed from the
          filename to get the target filename.  xz also  recognizes  the  suf‐
          fixes .txz and .tlz, and replaces them with the .tar suffix.

       If  the  target file already exists, an error is displayed and the file
       is skipped.

       Unless writing to standard output, xz will display a warning  and  skip
       the file if any of the following applies:

       ·  File  is  not  a regular file.  Symbolic links are not followed, and
          thus they are not considered to be regular files.

       ·  File has more than one hard link.

       ·  File has setuid, setgid, or sticky bit set.

       ·  The operation mode is set to compress and the  file  already  has  a
          suffix  of  the  target file format (.xz or .txz when compressing to
          the .xz format, and .lzma or .tlz when compressing to the .lzma for‐
          mat).

       ·  The  operation mode is set to decompress and the file doesn't have a
          suffix of any of the supported file formats (.xz,  .txz,  .lzma,  or
          .tlz).

       After successfully compressing or decompressing the file, xz copies the
       owner, group, permissions, access time, and modification time from  the
       source  file  to the target file.  If copying the group fails, the per‐
       missions are modified so that the target file doesn't become accessible
       to  users  who  didn't  have  permission to access the source file.  xz
       doesn't support copying other metadata like  access  control  lists  or
       extended attributes yet.

       Once  the  target file has been successfully closed, the source file is
       removed unless --keep was specified.  The source file is never  removed
       if the output is written to standard output.

       Sending  SIGINFO  or  SIGUSR1 to the xz process makes it print progress
       information to standard error.  This has only limited  use  since  when
       standard error is a terminal, using --verbose will display an automati‐
       cally updating progress indicator.

   Memory usage
       The memory usage of xz varies from a few hundred kilobytes  to  several
       gigabytes  depending  on  the  compression settings.  The settings used
       when compressing a file determine the memory requirements of the decom‐
       pressor.  Typically the decompressor needs 5 % to 20 % of the amount of
       memory that the compressor needed when creating the file.  For example,
       decompressing  a  file  created with xz -9 currently requires 65 MiB of
       memory.  Still, it is possible to have .xz files that  require  several
       gigabytes of memory to decompress.

       Especially  users  of  older  systems  may find the possibility of very
       large memory usage annoying.  To prevent  uncomfortable  surprises,  xz
       has  a  built-in  memory  usage  limiter, which is disabled by default.
       While some operating systems provide ways to limit the memory usage  of
       processes,  relying  on  it  wasn't  deemed to be flexible enough (e.g.
       using ulimit(1) to limit virtual memory tends to cripple mmap(2)).

       The memory usage limiter can be enabled with the  command  line  option
       --memlimit=limit.  Often it is more convenient to enable the limiter by
       default  by  setting  the  environment   variable   XZ_DEFAULTS,   e.g.
       XZ_DEFAULTS=--memlimit=150MiB.   It is possible to set the limits sepa‐
       rately for  compression  and  decompression  by  using  --memlimit-com‐
       press=limit  and  --memlimit-decompress=limit.  Using these two options
       outside XZ_DEFAULTS is rarely useful because a single run of xz  cannot
       do  both  compression  and  decompression  and  --memlimit=limit (or -

>>>BEGIN
ssh-agent
The idea is that ssh-agent is started
     in the beginning of an X-session or a login session, and all other win‐
     dows or programs are started as clients to the ssh-agent program.
     Through use of environment variables the agent can be located and auto‐
     matically used for authentication when logging in to other machines using
     ssh(1).

     The options are as follows:

     -a bind_address
             Bind the agent to the UNIX-domain socket bind_address.  The
             default is $TMPDIR/ssh-XXXXXXXXXX/agent.<ppid>.

     -c      Generate C-shell commands on stdout.  This is the default if
             SHELL looks like it's a csh style of shell.

     -d      Debug mode.  When this option is specified ssh-agent will not
             fork.

     -k      Kill the current agent (given by the SSH_AGENT_PID environment
             variable).

     -s      Generate Bourne shell commands on stdout.  This is the default if
             SHELL does not look like it's a csh style of shell.

     -t life
             Set a default value for the maximum lifetime of identities added
             to the agent.  The lifetime may be specified in seconds or in a
             time format specified in sshd_config(5).  A lifetime specified
             for an identity with ssh-add(1) overrides this value.  Without
             this option the default maximum lifetime is forever.

     If a commandline is given, this is executed as a subprocess of the agent.
     When the command dies, so does the agent.

     The agent initially does not have any private keys.  Keys are added using
     ssh-add(1).  When executed without arguments, ssh-add(1) adds the files
     ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and
     ~/.ssh/identity.  If the identity has a passphrase, ssh-add(1) asks for
     the passphrase on the terminal if it has one or from a small X11 program
     if running under X11.  If neither of these is the case then the authenti‐
     cation will fail.  It then sends the identity to the agent.  Several
     identities can be stored in the agent; the agent can automatically use
     any of these identities.  ssh-add -l displays the identities currently
     held by the agent.

     The idea is that the agent is run in the user's local PC, laptop, or ter‐
     minal.  Authentication data need not be stored on any other machine, and
     authentication passphrases never go over the network.  However, the con‐
     nection to the agent is forwarded over SSH remote logins, and the user
     can thus use the privileges given by the identities anywhere in the net‐
     work in a secure way.

     There are two main ways to get an agent set up: The first is that the
     agent starts a new subcommand into which some environment variables are
     exported, eg ssh-agent xterm &.  The second is that the agent prints the
     needed shell commands (either sh(1) or csh(1) syntax can be generated)
     which can be evaluated in the calling shell, eg eval `ssh-agent -s` for
     Bourne-type shells such as sh(1) or ksh(1) and eval `ssh-agent -c` for
     csh(1) and derivatives.

     Later ssh(1) looks at these variables and uses them to establish a con‐
     nection to the agent.

     The agent will never send a private key over its request channel.
     Instead, operations that require a private key will be performed by the
     agent, and the result will be returned to the requester.  This way, pri‐
     vate keys are not exposed to clients using the agent.

     A UNIX-domain socket is created and the name of this socket is stored in
     the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable.  The socket is made accessible
     only to the current user.  This method is easily abused by root or
     another instance of the same user.

     The SSH_AGENT_PID environment variable holds the agent's process ID.

     The agent exits automatically when the command given on the command line
     terminates.

     In Debian, ssh-agent is installed with the set-group-id bit set, to pre‐
     vent ptrace(2) attacks retrieving private key material.  This has the
     side-effect of causing the run-time linker to remove certain environment
     variables which might have security implications for set-id programs,
     including LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and TMPDIR.  If you need to set
     any of these environment variables, you will need to do so in the program
     executed by ssh-agent.

rsh
It is intended to replace rlogin
     and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between two
     untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary
     TCP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     ssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user
     name).  The user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using
     one of several methods depending on the protocol version used (see
     below).

     If command is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a
     login shell.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      Forces ssh to try protocol version 1 only.

     -2      Forces ssh to try protocol version 2 only.

     -4      Forces ssh to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces ssh to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A      Enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.  This
             can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration
             file.

             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
             agent's UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent through
             the forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material
             from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys
             that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into
             the agent.

     -a      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

     -b bind_address
             Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of
             the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than one
             address.

     -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,
             stderr, and data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections).  The
             compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the
             “level” can be controlled by the CompressionLevel option for pro‐
             tocol version 1.  Compression is desirable on modem lines and
             other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast
             networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis
             in the configuration files; see the Compression option.

     -c cipher_spec
             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

             Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher.  The
             supported values are “3des”, “blowfish”, and “des”.  3des
             (triple-des) is an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with three dif‐
             ferent keys.  It is believed to be secure.  blowfish is a fast
             block cipher; it appears very secure and is much faster than
             3des.  des is only supported in the ssh client for interoperabil‐
             ity with legacy protocol 1 implementations that do not support
             the 3des cipher.  Its use is strongly discouraged due to crypto‐
             graphic weaknesses.  The default is “3des”.

             For protocol version 2, cipher_spec is a comma-separated list of
             ciphers listed in order of preference.  See the Ciphers keyword
             in ssh_config(5) for more information.

     -D [bind_address:]port
             Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.
             This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local
             side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a
             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to
             determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently
             the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act
             as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.
             Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the configura‐
             tion file.

             IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in
             square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged
             ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with
             the GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may
             be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
             bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be
             bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates
             that the port should be available from all interfaces.

             Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.

     -e escape_char
             Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).
             The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a
             line.  The escape character followed by a dot (‘.’) closes the
             connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and
             followed by itself sends the escape character once.  Setting the
             character to “none” disables any escapes and makes the session
             fully transparent.

     -F configfile
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a con‐
             figuration file is given on the command line, the system-wide
             configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config) will be ignored.  The
             default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.

     -f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.
             This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or
             passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This
             implies -n.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a
             remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm.

             If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to “yes”,
             then a client started with -f will wait for all remote port for‐
             wards to be successfully established before placing itself in the
             background.

     -g      Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.

     -I pkcs11
             Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate
             with a PKCS#11 token providing the user's private RSA key.

     -i identity_file
             Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public
             key authentication is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/identity for
             protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa,
             ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa for protocol version 2.
             Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in the
             configuration file.  It is possible to have multiple -i options
             (and multiple identities specified in configuration files).  ssh
             will also try to load certificate information from the filename
             obtained by appending -cert.pub to identity filenames.

     -K      Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation)
             of GSSAPI credentials to the server.

     -k      Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the
             server.

     -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
             Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be
             forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side.  This
             works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side,
             optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a con‐
             nection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port
             hostport from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be
             specified in the configuration file.  IPv6 addresses can be spec‐
             ified by enclosing the address in square brackets.  Only the
             superuser can forward privileged ports.  By default, the local
             port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts setting.  How‐
             ever, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection
             to a specific address.  The bind_address of “localhost” indicates
             that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an
             empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be available
             from all interfaces.

     -l login_name
             Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.  This also
             may be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.

     -M      Places the ssh client into “master” mode for connection sharing.
             Multiple -M options places ssh into “master” mode with confirma‐
             tion required before slave connections are accepted.  Refer to
             the description of ControlMaster in ssh_config(5) for details.

     -m mac_spec
             Additionally, for protocol version 2 a comma-separated list of
             MAC (message authentication code) algorithms can be specified in
             order of preference.  See the MACs keyword for more information.

     -N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just for‐
             warding ports (protocol version 2 only).

     -n      Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually, prevents reading from
             stdin).  This must be used when ssh is run in the background.

       options.

       The environment's locale settings (see “ENVIRONMENT” below) are used to
       discern the locale's character set.  If no current locale can be deter‐
       mined, the locale “ru_RU.KOI8-R” (the Russian language as used  in  the
       territory  of  Russia,  with the KOI8-R character set) is assumed.  The
       locale(1) utility is used to determine whether the system supports  the
       selected  locale.   If  it does not, koi8rxterm will exit with an error
       and report the output of locale.

       Note: koi8rxterm may produce unexpected results if the  current  locale
       is  set to one in which the KOI8-R character encoding is not supported,
       or if fonts using that encoding are not available.  In the Debian  sys‐
       tem,  the  “xfonts-cyrillic” package provides the fonts that koi8rxterm
       uses by default.   To  change  the  fonts  koi8rxterm  uses,  edit  the
       /etc/X11/app-defaults/KOI8RXTerm file.

getopt
It  uses
       the GNU getopt(3) routines to do this.

       The  parameters  getopt  is  called with can be divided into two parts:
       options  which  modify  the  way  getopt  will   parse   (options   and
       -o|--options  optstring  in the SYNOPSIS), and the parameters which are
       to be parsed (parameters in the SYNOPSIS).  The second part will  start
       at  the  first  non-option parameter that is not an option argument, or
       after the first occurrence of `--'.  If no `-o' or  `--options'  option
       is  found  in the first part, the first parameter of the second part is
       used as the short options string.

       If the environment variable GETOPT_COMPATIBLE is set, or if  its  first
       parameter  is  not  an  option  (does not start with a `-', this is the
       first format in the SYNOPSIS), getopt will generate output that is com‐
       patible  with  that  of  other versions of getopt(1).  It will still do
       parameter shuffling and recognize optional arguments (see section  COM‐
       PATIBILITY for more information).

       Traditional implementations of getopt(1) are unable to cope with white‐
       space and other (shell-specific) special characters  in  arguments  and
       non-option  parameters.  To solve this problem, this implementation can
       generate quoted output which must once  again  be  interpreted  by  the
       shell  (usually by using the eval command). This has the effect of pre‐
       serving those characters, but you must call getopt in a way that is  no
       longer  compatible  with  other versions (the second or third format in
       the SYNOPSIS).  To determine whether this enhanced version of getopt(1)
       is installed, a special test option (-T) can be used.

It

       nals  such  as  VT320/VT420/VT520  (VTxxx).  It also provides Tektronix
       4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system directly.
       If the underlying operating system supports terminal resizing capabili‐
       ties (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd),
       xterm  will use the facilities to notify programs running in the window
       whenever it is resized.

       The VTxxx and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their  own  window  so
       that  you can edit text in one and look at graphics in the other at the
       same time.  To maintain the correct aspect ratio  (height/width),  Tek‐
       tronix  graphics  will  be  restricted to the largest box with a 4014's
       aspect ratio that will fit in the window.  This box is located  in  the
       upper left area of the window.

       Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is
       considered the “active” window for receiving keyboard input and  termi‐
       nal  output.   This  is  the window that contains the text cursor.  The

scriptreplay
The replay simply displays the information again; the programs that
       were run when the typescript was being recorded are not run again.
       Since the same information is simply being displayed, scriptreplay is
       only guaranteed to work properly if run on the same type of terminal
       the typescript was recorded on.  Otherwise, any escape characters in
       the typescript may be interpreted differently by the terminal to which
       scriptreplay is sending its output.

       The timing information is what script(1) outputs to standard error if
       it is run with the -t parameter.

       By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named "type‐
       script", but other filenames may be specified, as the second parameter
       or with option -s.

       If the third parameter is specified, it is used as a speed-up multi‐
       plier.  For example, a speed-up of 2 makes scriptreplay go twice as
       fast, and a speed-up of 0.1 makes it go ten times slower than the orig‐

     When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt character.  The other
     user will see the message ‘EOF’ indicating that the conversation is over.

     You can prevent people (other than the super-user) from writing to you
     with the mesg(1) command.

     If the user you want to write to is logged in on more than one terminal,
     you can specify which terminal to write to by specifying the terminal
     name as the second operand to the write command.  Alternatively, you can
     let write select one of the terminals - it will pick the one with the
     shortest idle time.  This is so that if the user is logged in at work and
     also dialed up from home, the message will go to the right place.

     The traditional protocol for writing to someone is that the string ‘-o’,
     either at the end of a line or on a line by itself, means that it is the

update-alternatives
It is possible for several programs  fulfilling  the  same  or  similar
       functions  to  be  installed  on a single system at the same time.  For
       example, many systems have several  text  editors  installed  at  once.
       This gives choice to the users of a system, allowing each to use a dif‐
       ferent editor, if desired, but makes it difficult for a program to make
       a  good  choice for an editor to invoke if the user has not specified a
       particular preference.

       Debian's alternatives system aims to solve  this  problem.   A  generic
       name in the filesystem is shared by all files providing interchangeable
       functionality.  The alternatives system and  the  system  administrator
       together  determine  which  actual  file  is referenced by this generic
       name.  For example, if the text  editors  ed(1)  and  nvi(1)  are  both
       installed on the system, the alternatives system will cause the generic
       name /usr/bin/editor to refer to /usr/bin/nvi by  default.  The  system
       administrator  can  override  this and cause it to refer to /usr/bin/ed
       instead, and the alternatives system will not alter this setting  until
       explicitly requested to do so.

       The generic name is not a direct symbolic link to the selected alterna‐
       tive.  Instead, it is a symbolic link to a  name  in  the  alternatives
       directory,  which  in turn is a symbolic link to the actual file refer‐
       enced.  This is done so that the system administrator's changes can  be
       confined  within  the  /etc directory: the FHS (q.v.) gives reasons why
       this is a Good Thing.

       When each package providing a file with a particular  functionality  is
       installed,  changed or removed, update-alternatives is called to update
       information about that file in the alternatives system.   update-alter‐
       natives  is  usually  called  from  the  postinst  (configure) or prerm
       (install) scripts in Debian packages.

       It is often useful for a number of alternatives to be synchronized,  so
       that they are changed as a group; for example, when several versions of
       the  vi(1)  editor  are  installed,  the   man   page   referenced   by
       /usr/share/man/man1/vi.1 should correspond to the executable referenced
       by /usr/bin/vi.  update-alternatives handles this by  means  of  master
       and  slave links; when the master is changed, any associated slaves are
       changed too.  A master link and its associated slaves make  up  a  link
       group.

       Each  link  group is, at any given time, in one of two modes: automatic
       or manual.  When a group is in automatic mode, the alternatives  system
       will  automatically  decide,  as  packages  are  installed and removed,
       whether and how to update the links.  In manual mode, the  alternatives
       system  will  retain the choice of the administrator and avoid changing
       the links (except when something is broken).

       Link groups are in automatic mode when they are first introduced to the
       system.   If  the  system  administrator  makes changes to the system's
       automatic settings, this will be noticed the next time  update-alterna‐
       tives  is run on the changed link's group, and the group will automati‐
       cally be switched to manual mode.

       Each alternative has a priority associated with it.  When a link  group
       is  in  automatic  mode,  the alternatives pointed to by members of the
       group will be those which have the highest priority.

       When using the --config option, update-alternatives will  list  all  of
       the choices for the link group of which given name is the master alter‐
       native name. The current choice is marked with a '*'.  You will then be
       prompted  for  your choice regarding this link group.  Depending on the
       choice made, the link group might no longer be in auto mode.  You  will
       need  to use the --auto option in order to return to the automatic mode
       (or you can rerun --config and select the entry marked as automatic).

       If you want to configure non-interactively you can use the --set option
       instead (see below).

       Different packages providing the same file need to do so cooperatively.
       In other words, the usage of update-alternatives is mandatory  for  all
       involved  packages  in  such  case. It is not possible to override some
       file in a package that does not employ the  update-alternatives  mecha‐
       nism.

       normal  MS-DOS formatted floppy. Copy one or more Linux kernel files to
       it, then execute the command:

              syslinux /dev/fd0

       This will alter the boot sector on the  disk  and  copy  a  file  named
       LDLINUX.SYS into its root directory.

       On  boot  time,  by  default,  the kernel will be loaded from the image
       named LINUX on the boot floppy.  This default can be changed,  see  the
       section on the syslinux configuration file.

       If  the  Shift  or  Alt  keys are held down during boot, or the Caps or
       Scroll locks are set, syslinux will display a  lilo(8)  -style  "boot:"
       prompt.  The user can then type a kernel file name followed by any ker‐
       nel parameters. The syslinux loader does not need  to  know  about  the

       located in the root directory on the disk.

gconftool-2
A GConf preference key is an element in the GConf repository that
       corresponds  to  an  application preference.  Preference keys typically
       have simple values such as strings, integers, or lists of  strings  and
       integers.  The default key-value pairs are installed on the system, and
       are known as schemas. gconftool-2 is the  command-line  interface  tool
       that enables you to set the values of keys, display the values of keys,
       and install schemas from schema definition files when  you  install  an
       application.  The  GConf  preference keys are stored and managed by the
       GConf daemon (gconfd-2).  These keys are cached in memory, and saved to
       disk in XML format when appropriate.

gs
gs reads "files" in sequence and executes them as
       Ghostscript programs. After doing this, it reads further input from the
       standard input stream (normally the keyboard), interpreting  each  line
       separately and output to an output device (may be a file or an X11 win‐
       dow preview, see below).  The  interpreter  exits  gracefully  when  it
       encounters  the "quit" command (either in a file or from the keyboard),
       at end-of-file, or at an interrupt signal (such  as  Control-C  at  the
       keyboard).

       The  interpreter  recognizes  many  option  switches, some of which are
       described below. Please see the usage documentation for complete infor‐
       mation.  Switches  may appear anywhere in the command line and apply to
       all files thereafter.  Invoking Ghostscript with the -h  or  -?  switch
       produces a message which shows several useful switches, all the devices
       known to that executable, and the search path for  fonts;  on  Unix  it
       also shows the location of detailed documentation.

       Ghostscript  may be built to use many different output devices.  To see
       which devices your executable includes, run "gs -h".

       Unless you specify a particular device, Ghostscript normally opens  the
       first one of those and directs output to it.

       If  built  with  X11 support, often the default device is an X11 window
       (previewer), else ghostscript will typically use the  bbox  device  and
       print on stdout the dimension of the postscript file.

       So  if the first one in the list is the one you want to use, just issue
       the command

            gs myfile.ps

       You can also check the set of  available  devices  from  within  Ghost‐
       script: invoke Ghostscript and type

            devicenames ==

       but  the  first  device  on  the  resulting list may not be the default
       device you determine with "gs -h".  To specify "AbcXyz" as the  initial
       output device, include the switch

            -sDEVICE=AbcXyz

       For example, for output to an Epson printer you might use the command

            gs -sDEVICE=epson myfile.ps

       The  "-sDEVICE="  switch  must  precede  the first mention of a file to
       print, and only the switch's first use has any effect.

       Finally, you can specify a default device in the  environment  variable
       GS_DEVICE.  The order of precedence for these alternatives from highest
       to lowest (Ghostscript uses the device defined highest in the list) is:

       Some devices can support different resolutions (densities).  To specify
       the resolution on such a printer, use the "-r" switch:

            gs -sDEVICE=<device> -r<xres>x<yres>

       For  example,  on a 9-pin Epson-compatible printer, you get the lowest-
       density (fastest) mode with

            gs -sDEVICE=epson -r60x72

       and the highest-density (best output quality) mode with

            gs -sDEVICE=epson -r240x72.

       If you select a printer as the output device, Ghostscript  also  allows
       you  to  choose  where Ghostscript sends the output -- on Unix systems,
       usually to a temporary file.  To send the output to a  file  "foo.xyz",
       use the switch

            -sOutputFile=foo.xyz

       You  might  want  to  print each page separately.  To do this, send the
       output to a series of files "foo1.xyz, foo2.xyz, ..." using the "-sOut‐
       putFile=" switch with "%d" in a filename template:

            -sOutputFile=foo%d.xyz

       Each resulting file receives one page of output, and the files are num‐
       bered in sequence.  "%d" is a printf format specification; you can also
       use a variant like "%02d".

       On Unix and MS Windows systems you can also send output to a pipe.  For
       example, to pipe output to the "lpr" command (which, on many Unix  sys‐
       tems, directs it to a printer), use the option

            -sOutputFile=%pipe%lpr

       Note  that the '%' characters need to be doubled on MS Windows to avoid
       mangling by the command interpreter.

       You can also send output to standard output:

            -sOutputFile=-
       or
            -sOutputFile=%stdout%

       In this case you must also use the -q switch,  to  prevent  Ghostscript
       from writing messages to standard output.

       To select a specific paper size, use the command line switch

            -sPAPERSIZE=<paper_size>

       for instance

            -sPAPERSIZE=a4
       or
            -sPAPERSIZE=legal

       Most ISO and US paper sizes are recognized. See the usage documentation
       for a  full  list,  or  the  definitions  in  the  initialization  file
       "gs_statd.ps".

       Ghostscript  can do many things other than print or view PostScript and
       PDF files.  For example, if you want to know  the  bounding  box  of  a
       PostScript  (or EPS) file, Ghostscript provides a special "device" that
       just prints out this information.

       For example, using one of the example  files  distributed  with  Ghost‐
       script,

            gs -sDEVICE=bbox golfer.ps

       prints out

            %%BoundingBox: 0 25 583 732
            %%HiResBoundingBox: 0.808497 25.009496 582.994503 731.809445

The persistent servers, while pub‐
       lishing the persistent object references in the Naming Service, include
       the port number of the ORBD in the object reference instead of the port
       number of the Server. The inclusion of an ORBD port number in the
       object reference for persistent object references has the following
       advantages:

          o The object reference in the Naming Service remains independent of
            the server life cycle. For example, the object reference could be
            published by the server in the Naming Service when it is first
            installed, and then, independent of how many times the server is
            started or shutdown, the ORBD will always return the correct
            object reference to the invoking client.

          o The client needs to lookup the object reference in the Naming Ser‐
            vice only once, and can keep re-using this reference independent
            of the changes introduced due to server life cycle.


       To access ORBD's Server Manager, the server must be started using
       servertool(1), which is a command-line interface for application pro‐
       grammers to register, unregister, startup, and shutdown a persistent
       server. For more information on the Server Manager, see the section in
       this document titled Server Manager.

       When orbd starts up, it also starts a naming service. For more informa‐

javac
It can also process annotations in Java source files and classes.

       There are two ways to pass source code file names to javac:

          o For  a small number of source files, simply list the file names on
            the command line.

          o For a large number of source files, list the file names in a file,
            separated by blanks or line breaks. Then use the list file name on
            the javac command line, preceded by an @ character.


       Source code file names must have .java suffixes, class file names  must
       have  .class  suffixes,  and both source and class files must have root
       names that identify the class. For  example,  a  class  called  MyClass
       would be written in a source file called MyClass.java and compiled into
       a bytecode class file called MyClass.class.

       Inner class definitions produce additional  class  files.  These  class
       files  have  names  combining  the inner and outer class names, such as
       MyClass$MyInnerClass.class.

       You should arrange source files in a directory tree that reflects their
       package  tree.  For  example,  if  you  keep  all  your source files in
       /workspace, the source code for com.mysoft.mypack.MyClass should be  in
       /workspace/com/mysoft/mypack/MyClass.java.

       By  default, the compiler puts each class file in the same directory as
       its source file. You can specify a separate destination directory  with
       -d (see Options, below).

       and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By
       contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence,
       which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.

       Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local
       versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure
       of the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as "recursive
       downloading."  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion
       Standard (/robots.txt).  Wget can be instructed to convert the links in
       downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline viewing.

       Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
       connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep
       retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the server

toe
File  arguments  specify  the  directories  to  be
       scanned;  if  no such arguments are given, your default terminfo direc‐
       tory is scanned.  If you also specify the -h option, a directory header
       will be issued as each directory is entered.

       There are other options intended for use by terminfo file maintainers:

       -a     report  on  all  of  the  terminal databases which ncurses would
              search, rather than only the first one that it finds.

              If the -s is also given, toe adds a column to the report,  show‐
              ing  (like  conflict(1))  which  entries which belong to a given
              terminal database.  An "*" marks entries which differ,  and  "+"
              marks equivalent entries.

       -s     sort the output by the entry names.

       -u file
              says to write a report to the standard output, listing dependen‐
              cies in the given terminfo/termcap source file.  The report con‐
              denses  the  `use'  relation:  each line consists of the primary
              name of a terminal that has  use  capabilities,  followed  by  a
              colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary names of all
              terminals which occur in those use capabilities, followed  by  a
              newline

       -U file
              says  to  write a report to the standard output, listing reverse
              dependencies in the given  terminfo/termcap  source  file.   The
              report  reverses  the  `use' relation: each line consists of the
              primary name of a terminal that occurs in use capabilities, fol‐
              lowed  by  a colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary
              names of all terminals which depend on it, followed  by  a  new‐
              line.

       -vn    specifies  that  (verbose)  output be written to standard error,
              showing toe's progress.  The optional parameter n  is  a  number
              from 1 to 10, interpreted as for tic(1).

       -V     reports  the  version of ncurses which was used in this program,

renice
The following who parameters are interpreted as process ID's, process
     group ID's, or user names.  Renice'ing a process group causes all pro‐
     cesses in the process group to have their scheduling priority altered.
     Renice'ing a user causes all processes owned by the user to have their
     scheduling priority altered.  By default, the processes to be affected
     are specified by their process ID's.

     Options supported by renice:

     -n, --priority
             The scheduling priority of the process, process group, or user.

     -g, --pgrp
             Force who parameters to be interpreted as process group ID's.

     -u, --user
             Force the who parameters to be interpreted as user names.

     -p, --pid
             Resets the who interpretation to be (the default) process ID's.

     -v, --version
             Print version.

     -h, --help
             Print help.

     For example,

     renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32

     would change the priority of process ID's 987 and 32, and all processes
     owned by users daemon and root.

     Users other than the super-user may only alter the priority of processes
     they own, and can only monotonically increase their ``nice value'' (for
     security reasons) within the range 0 to PRIO_MAX (20), unless a nice
     resource limit is set (Linux 2.6.12 and higher).  The super-user may
     alter the priority of any process and set the priority to any value in
     the range PRIO_MIN (-20) to PRIO_MAX.  Useful priorities are: 20 (the
     affected processes will run only when nothing else in the system wants
     to), 0 (the ``base'' scheduling priority), anything negative (to make
     things go very fast).

CPU affinity is a scheduler property that "bonds" a process
       to a given set of CPUs on the system.  The Linux scheduler  will  honor
       the  given CPU affinity and the process will not run on any other CPUs.
       Note that the Linux scheduler also supports natural CPU  affinity:  the
       scheduler attempts to keep processes on the same CPU as long as practi‐
       cal for performance reasons.  Therefore, forcing a specific CPU  affin‐
       ity is useful only in certain applications.

       The CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask, with the lowest order bit
       corresponding to the first logical CPU and the highest order bit corre‐
       sponding  to  the  last logical CPU.  Not all CPUs may exist on a given
       system but a mask may specify more CPUs than are present.  A  retrieved
       mask  will  reflect only the bits that correspond to CPUs physically on
       the system.  If an invalid mask is given (i.e., one that corresponds to
       no  valid  CPUs on the current system) an error is returned.  The masks
       are typically given in hexadecimal.  For example,

sudoedit
sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/out‐
     put logging.  Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy
     and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end.  The
     default security policy is sudoers, which is configured via the file
     /etc/sudoers, or via LDAP.  See the Plugins section for more information.

     The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run
     sudo.  The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a
     password or another authentication mechanism.  If authentication is
     required, sudo will exit if the user's password is not entered within a
     configurable time limit.  This limit is policy-specific; the default
     password prompt timeout for the sudoers security policy is unlimited.

     Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user to run
     sudo again for a period of time without requiring authentication.  The
     sudoers policy caches credentials for 15 minutes, unless overridden in
     sudoers(5).  By running sudo with the -v option, a user can update the
     cached credentials without running a command.

     When invoked as sudoedit, the -e option (described below), is implied.

     Security policies may log successful and failed attempts to use sudo.  If
     an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input and output may
     be logged as well.

     The options are as follows:

     -A, --askpass
                 Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will read it from
                 the user's terminal.  If the -A (askpass) option is speci‐
                 fied, a (possibly graphical) helper program is executed to
                 read the user's password and output the password to the stan‐
                 dard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable is
                 set, it specifies the path to the helper program.  Otherwise,
                 if sudo.conf(5) contains a line specifying the askpass pro‐
                 gram, that value will be used.  For example:

                     # Path to askpass helper program
                     Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass

                 If no askpass program is available, sudo will exit with an
                 error.

     -b, --background
                 Run the given command in the background.  Note that it is not
                 possible to use shell job control to manipulate background
                 processes started by sudo.  Most interactive commands will
                 fail to work properly in background mode.

     -C num, --close-from=num
                 Close all file descriptors greater than or equal to num
                 before executing a command.  Values less than three are not
                 permitted.  By default, sudo will close all open file
                 descriptors other than standard input, standard output and
                 standard error when executing a command.  The security policy
                 may restrict the user's ability to use this option.  The
                 sudoers policy only permits use of the -C option when the
                 administrator has enabled the closefrom_override option.

     -E, --preserve-env
                 Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to pre‐
                 serve their existing environment variables.  The security
                 policy may return an error if the user does not have permis‐
                 sion to preserve the environment.

     -e, --edit  Edit one or more files instead of running a command.  In lieu
                 of a path name, the string "sudoedit" is used when consulting
                 the security policy.  If the user is authorized by the pol‐
                 icy, the following steps are taken:

                 1.   Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with
                      the owner set to the invoking user.

                 2.   The editor specified by the policy is run to edit the
                      temporary files.  The sudoers policy uses the
                      SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables (in
                      that order).  If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or

             number, it may be followed by the letter ‘f’ or ‘p’ to indicate
             the following or preceding month of that number, respectively.

             to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back
             to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her
             colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

     -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

             example, “cal -y -B-6” shows July to December. And “cal -A11”

     -M      Weeks start on Monday.

     -S      Weeks start on Sunday.

     -b      Use oldstyle format for ncal output.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1–9999) to be displayed; note the
     year must be fully specified: “cal 89” will not display a calendar for
     1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a
     number between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by
     the current locale.  Month and year default to those of the current sys‐
     tem clock and time zone (so “cal -m 8” will display a calendar for the
     month of August in the current year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example, the options -y, -3,

     later ones take precedence over the earlier ones.

     A year starts on January 1.

POST
The request content for POST and PUT methods is read from
       stdin.  The content of the response is printed on stdout.  Error
       messages are printed on stderr.  The program returns a status value
       indicating the number of URLs that failed.

       The options are:

       -m <method>
           Set which method to use for the request.  If this option is not
           used, then the method is derived from the name of the program.

       -f  Force request through, even if the program believes that the method
           is illegal.  The server might reject the request eventually.

       -b <uri>
           This URI will be used as the base URI for resolving all relative
           URIs given as argument.

       -t <timeout>
           Set the timeout value for the requests.  The timeout is the amount
           of time that the program will wait for a response from the remote
           server before it fails.  The default unit for the timeout value is
           seconds.  You might append "m" or "h" to the timeout value to make
           it minutes or hours, respectively.  The default timeout is '3m',
           i.e. 3 minutes.

       -i <time>
           Set the If-Modified-Since header in the request. If time is the
           name of a file, use the modification timestamp for this file. If
           time is not a file, it is parsed as a literal date. Take a look at
           HTTP::Date for recognized formats.

       -c <content-type>
           Set the Content-Type for the request.  This option is only allowed
           for requests that take a content, i.e. POST and PUT.  You can force
           methods to take content by using the "-f" option together with
           "-c".  The default Content-Type for POST is
           "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".  The default Content-type for
           the others is "text/plain".

       -p <proxy-url>
           Set the proxy to be used for the requests.  The program also loads
           proxy settings from the environment.  You can disable this with the
           "-P" option.

nmcli
It is not meant as a full replacement for nm‐applet
       or other similar clients but as a complementary utility to those pro‐

       for power users who prefer the command line.

       Typical applications include:

       —   Initscripts: ifup/ifdown can utilize NetworkManager via nmcli
           instead of having to manage connections itself and possibly inter‐
           fere with NetworkManager.

       —   Servers, headless machines: No GUI is available; then nmcli can be
           used to activate/deactivate connections.  However, if a connection
           requires a secret in order to activate and if that secret is not
           stored at the system level, nmcli will not be able to activate it;
           it is currently unable to supply the secrets to NetworkManager.

       —   User sessions: nmcli can be used to activate/deactivate connections
           from the command line, but a client with a secret agent (like nm‐
           applet) is needed for supplying secrets not stored at the system
           level. Keyring dialogs and password prompts may appear if this hap‐
           pens.

pftp
The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote
     network site.

     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command inter‐
     preter.

     -4    Use only IPv4 to contact any host.

     -6    Use IPv6 only.

     -p    Use passive mode for data transfers. Allows use of ftp in environ‐
           ments where a firewall prevents connections from the outside world
           back to the client machine. Requires that the ftp server support
           the PASV command. This is the default if invoked as pftp.

     -i    Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     -n    Restrains ftp from attempting “auto-login” upon initial connection.
           If auto-login is enabled, ftp will check the .netrc (see netrc(5))
           file in the user's home directory for an entry describing an
           account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists, ftp will prompt
           for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on
           the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an
           account with which to login.

     -e    Disables command editing and history support, if it was compiled
           into the ftp executable. Otherwise, does nothing.

     -g    Disables file name globbing.

     -v    Verbose option forces ftp to show all responses from the remote
           server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     -d    Enables debugging.

     The client host and an optional port number with which ftp is to communi‐
     cate may be specified on the command line.  If this is done, ftp will
     immediately attempt to establish a connection to an FTP server on that
     host; otherwise, ftp will enter its command interpreter and await
     instructions from the user.  When ftp is awaiting commands from the user
     the prompt ‘ftp>’ is provided to the user.  The following commands are
     recognized by ftp:

     ! [command [args]]
                 Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there
                 are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
                 directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

     $ macro-name [args]
                 Execute the macro macro-name that was defined with the macdef
                 command.  Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.

     account [passwd]
                 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
                 for access to resources once a login has been successfully
                 completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
                 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     append local-file [remote-file]
                 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
                 remote-file is left unspecified, the local file name is used
                 in naming the remote file after being altered by any ntrans
                 or nmap setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 type, format, mode, and structure.

     ascii       Set the file transfer type to network ASCII.  This is the
                 default type.

     bell        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer com‐
                 mand is completed.

     binary      Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer.

     bye         Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit
                 ftp.  An end of file will also terminate the session and
                 exit.

     case        Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during mget
                 commands.  When case is on (default is off), remote computer
                 file names with all letters in upper case are written in the
                 local directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

     cd remote-directory
                 Change the working directory on the remote machine to
                 remote-directory.

     cdup        Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of
                 the current remote machine working directory.

     chmod mode file-name
                 Change the permission modes of the file file-name on the
                 remote sytem to mode.

     close       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return
                 to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros are erased.

     cr          Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file
                 retrieval.  Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed
                 sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When cr is on (the
                 default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence to
                 conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.
                 Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain single line‐
                 feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds
                 may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when cr is
                 off.

     qc          Toggle the printing of control characters in the output of
                 ASCII type commands.  When this is turned on, control charac‐
                 ters are replaced with a question mark if the output file is
                 the standard output.  This is the default when the standard
                 output is a tty.

     delete remote-file
                 Delete the file remote-file on the remote machine.

     debug [debug-value]
                 Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional debug-value is speci‐
                 fied it is used to set the debugging level.  When debugging
                 is on, ftp prints each command sent to the remote machine,
                 preceded by the string ‘-->’

     dir [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a listing of the directory contents in the directory,
                 remote-directory, and, optionally, placing the output in
                 local-file.  If interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt
                 the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the tar‐
                 get local file for receiving dir output.  If no directory is
                 specified, the current working directory on the remote
                 machine is used.  If no local file is specified, or
                 local-file is -, output comes to the terminal.

     disconnect  A synonym for close.

     form format
                 Set the file transfer form to format.  The default format is
                 “file”.

     get remote-file [local-file]
                 Retrieve the remote-file and store it on the local machine.
                 If the local file name is not specified, it is given the same
                 name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
                 the current case, ntrans, and nmap settings.  The current
                 settings for type, form, mode, and structure are used while
                 transferring the file.

     glob        Toggle filename expansion for mdelete, mget and mput.  If
                 globbing is turned off with glob, the file name arguments are
                 taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for mput is done
                 as in csh(1).  For mdelete and mget, each remote file name is
                 expanded separately on the remote machine and the lists are
                 not merged.  Expansion of a directory name is likely to be
                 different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the
                 exact result depends on the foreign operating system and ftp
                 server, and can be previewed by doing ‘mls remote-files -’
                 Note: mget and mput are not meant to transfer entire direc‐
                 tory subtrees of files.  That can be done by transferring a
                 tar(1) archive of the subtree (in binary mode).

     hash        Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block trans‐
                 ferred.  The size of a data block is 1024 bytes.

     help [command]
                 Print an informative message about the meaning of command.
                 If no argument is given, ftp prints a list of the known com‐
                 mands.

     idle [seconds]
                 Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to seconds sec‐
                 onds.  If seconds is omitted, the current inactivity timer is
                 printed.

     ipany       Allow the address resolver to return any address family.

     ipv4        Restrict the address resolver to look only for IPv4
                 addresses.

     ipv6        Restrict host adressing to IPv6 only.

     lcd [directory]
                 Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no
                 directory is specified, the user's home directory is used.

     ls [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
                 machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa‐
                 tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
                 UNIX systems will produce output from the command ‘ls -l’.
                 (See also nlist.)  If remote-directory is left unspecified,
                 the current working directory is used.  If interactive
                 prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the
                 last argument is indeed the target local file for receiving
                 ls output.  If no local file is specified, or if local-file
                 is ‘-’, the output is sent to the terminal.

     macdef macro-name
                 Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
                 macro-name; a null line (consecutive newline characters in a
                 file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macro
                 input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total
                 characters in all defined macros.  Macros remain defined
                 until a close command is executed.  The macro processor
                 interprets `$' and `\' as special characters.  A `$' followed
                 by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding
                 argument on the macro invocation command line.  A `$' fol‐
                 lowed by an `i' signals that macro processor that the execut‐
                 ing macro is to be looped.  On the first pass `$i' is
                 replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation com‐
                 mand line, on the second pass it is replaced by the second
                 argument, and so on.  A `\' followed by any character is
                 replaced by that character.  Use the `\' to prevent special
                 treatment of the `$'.

     mdelete [remote-files]
                 Delete the remote-files on the remote machine.

     mdir remote-files local-file
                 Like dir, except multiple remote files may be specified.  If
                 interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to ver‐
                 ify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
                 for receiving mdir output.

     mget remote-files
                 Expand the remote-files on the remote machine and do a get
                 for each file name thus produced.  See glob for details on
                 the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be
                 processed according to case, ntrans, and nmap settings.
                 Files are transferred into the local working directory, which
                 can be changed with ‘lcd directory’; new local directories
                 can be created with ‘! mkdir directory’.

     mkdir directory-name
                 Make a directory on the remote machine.

     mls remote-files local-file
                 Like nlist, except multiple remote files may be specified,
                 and the local-file must be specified.  If interactive prompt‐
                 ing is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last
                 argument is indeed the target local file for receiving mls
                 output.

     mode [mode-name]
                 Set the file transfer mode to mode-name.  The default mode is
                 “stream” mode.

     modtime file-name
                 Show the last modification time of the file on the remote
                 machine.

     mput local-files
                 Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as argu‐
                 ments and do a put for each file in the resulting list.  See
                 glob for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file names
                 will then be processed according to ntrans and nmap settings.

     newer file-name [local-file]
                 Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file
                 is more recent that the file on the current system.  If the
                 file does not exist on the current system, the remote file is
                 considered newer.  Otherwise, this command is identical to
                 get.

     nlist [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a  list of the files in a directory on the remote
                 machine.  If remote-directory is left unspecified, the cur‐
                 rent working directory is used.  If interactive prompting is
                 on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last argument
                 is indeed the target local file for receiving nlist output.
                 If no local file is specified, or if local-file is -, the
                 output is sent to the terminal.

     nmap [inpattern outpattern]
                 Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments
                 are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset.  If
                 arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
                 mput commands and put commands issued without a specified
                 remote target filename.  If arguments are specified, local
                 filenames are mapped during mget commands and get commands
                 issued without a specified local target filename.  This com‐
                 mand is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer
                 with different file naming conventions or practices.  The
                 mapping follows the pattern set by inpattern and outpattern.
                 [Inpattern] is a template for incoming filenames (which may
                 have already been processed according to the ntrans and case
                 settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by including
                 the sequences `$1', `$2', ..., `$9' in inpattern.  Use `\' to
                 prevent this special treatment of the `$' character.  All
                 other characters are treated literally, and are used to
                 determine the nmap [inpattern] variable values.  For example,
                 given inpattern $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data",
                 $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2 would have the value
                 "data".  The outpattern determines the resulting mapped file‐
                 name.  The sequences `$1', `$2', ...., `$9' are replaced by
                 any value resulting from the inpattern template.  The
                 sequence `$0' is replace by the original filename.  Addition‐
                 ally, the sequence ‘[seq1, seq2]’ is replaced by [seq1] if
                 seq1 is not a null string; otherwise it is replaced by seq2.
                 For example, the command

                       nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

                 would yield the output filename "myfile.data" for input file‐
                 names "myfile.data" and "myfile.data.old", "myfile.file" for
                 the input filename "myfile", and "myfile.myfile" for the
                 input filename ".myfile".  Spaces may be included in
                 outpattern, as in the example: `nmap $1 sed "s/  *$//" > $1'
                 .  Use the `\' character to prevent special treatment of the
                 `$','[','[', and `,' characters.

     ntrans [inchars [outchars]]
                 Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
                 If no arguments are specified, the filename character trans‐
                 lation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, char‐
                 acters in remote filenames are translated during mput com‐
                 mands and put commands issued without a specified remote tar‐
                 get filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in
                 local filenames are translated during mget commands and get
                 commands issued without a specified local target filename.
                 This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
                 computer with different file naming conventions or practices.
                 Characters in a filename matching a character in inchars are
                 replaced with the corresponding character in outchars.  If
                 the character's position in inchars is longer than the length
                 of outchars, the character is deleted from the file name.

     open host [port]
                 Establish a connection to the specified host FTP server.  An
                 optional port number may be supplied, in which case, ftp will
                 attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the
                 auto-login option is on (default), ftp will also attempt to
                 automatically log the user in to the FTP server (see below).

     prompt      Toggle interactive prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs
                 during multiple file transfers to allow the user to selec‐
                 tively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off
                 (default is on), any mget or mput will transfer all files,
                 and any mdelete will delete all files.

     proxy ftp-command
                 Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.
                 This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote ftp
                 servers for transferring files between the two servers.  The
                 first proxy command should be an open, to establish the sec‐
                 ondary control connection.  Enter the command "proxy ?" to
                 see other ftp commands executable on the secondary connec‐
                 tion.  The following commands behave differently when pref‐
                 aced by proxy: open will not define new macros during the
                 auto-login process, close will not erase existing macro defi‐
                 nitions, get and mget transfer files from the host on the
                 primary control connection to the host on the secondary con‐
                 trol connection, and put, mput, and append transfer files
                 from the host on the secondary control connection to the host
                 on the primary control connection.  Third party file trans‐
                 fers depend upon support of the ftp protocol PASV command by
                 the server on the secondary control connection.

     put local-file [remote-file]
                 Store a local file on the remote machine.  If remote-file is
                 left unspecified, the local file name is used after process‐
                 ing according to any ntrans or nmap settings in naming the
                 remote file.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 type, format, mode, and structure.

file
file tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three
     sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem tests, magic tests,
     and language tests.  The first test that succeeds causes the file type to
     be printed.

     The type printed will usually contain one of the words text (the file
     contains only printing characters and a few common control characters and
     is probably safe to read on an ASCII terminal), executable (the file con‐
     tains the result of compiling a program in a form understandable to some
     UNIX kernel or another), or data meaning anything else (data is usually
     “binary” or non-printable).  Exceptions are well-known file formats (core
     files, tar archives) that are known to contain binary data.  When adding
     local definitions to /etc/magic, make sure to preserve these keywords.
     Users depend on knowing that all the readable files in a directory have
     the word “text” printed.  Don't do as Berkeley did and change “shell
     commands text” to “shell script”.

     The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a stat(2)
     system call.  The program checks to see if the file is empty, or if it's
     some sort of special file.  Any known file types appropriate to the sys‐
     tem you are running on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs)
     on those systems that implement them) are intuited if they are defined in
     the system header file <sys/stat.h>.

     The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed
     formats.  The canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled
     program) a.out file, whose format is defined in <elf.h>, <a.out.h> and
     possibly <exec.h> in the standard include directory.  These files have a
     “magic number” stored in a particular place near the beginning of the
     file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a binary exe‐
     cutable, and which of several types thereof.  The concept of a “magic”
     has been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some invari‐
     ant identifier at a small fixed offset into the file can usually be
     described in this way.  The information identifying these files is read
     from /etc/magic and the compiled magic file /usr/share/misc/magic.mgc, or
     the files in the directory /usr/share/misc/magic if the compiled file
     does not exist.  In addition, if $HOME/.magic.mgc or $HOME/.magic exists,
     it will be used in preference to the system magic files.

     If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is
     examined to see if it seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-
     ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character sets (such as those used on Macintosh
     and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and
     EBCDIC character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges and
     sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.  If a file
     passes any of these tests, its character set is reported.  ASCII,
     ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as “text”
     because they will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and
     EBCDIC are only “character data” because, while they contain text, it is
     text that will require translation before it can be read.  In addition,
     file will attempt to determine other characteristics of text-type files.
     If the lines of a file are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead of the
     Unix-standard LF, this will be reported.  Files that contain embedded
     escape sequences or overstriking will also be identified.

     Once file has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it
     will attempt to determine in what language the file is written.  The lan‐
     guage tests look for particular strings (cf.  <names.h>) that can appear
     anywhere in the first few blocks of a file.  For example, the keyword .br
     indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1) input file, just as the
     keyword struct indicates a C program.  These tests are less reliable than
     the previous two groups, so they are performed last.  The language test
     routines also test for some miscellany (such as tar(1) archives).

     Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the
     character sets listed above is simply said to be “data”.

This will display the headers
       returned and the initial part of the content, escaped so that it's safe
       to display even binary content.  The escapes syntax used is the same as
       for Perl's double quoted strings.  If there is no content the string
       "(no content)" is shown in its place.

       The following options are recognized:

       --agent str
           Override the user agent string passed to the server.

       --keep-client-headers
           LWP internally generate various "Client-*" headers that are
           stripped by lwp-dump in order to show the headers exactly as the
           server provided them.  This option will suppress this.

awk
The AWK lan‐
       guage is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and pro‐
       cessing,  and  for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms.  mawk
       is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in  Aho,
       Kernighan  and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
       Publishing, 1988.  (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.)  mawk  con‐
       forms  to  the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
       which contains a few features not described in the AWK book,  and  mawk
       provides a small number of extensions.

       An  AWK  program  is  a sequence of pattern {action} pairs and function
       definitions.  Short programs are entered on the  command  line  usually
       enclosed  in ' ' to avoid shell interpretation.  Longer programs can be
       read in from a file with the -f option.  Data  input is read  from  the
       list  of files on the command line or from standard input when the list
       is empty.  The input is broken into records as determined by the record
       separator  variable,  RS.  Initially, RS = "\n" and records are synony‐
       mous with lines.  Each record is compared against each pattern  and  if
       it matches, the program text for {action} is executed.

slogin
It is intended to replace rlogin
     and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between two
     untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary
     TCP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     ssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user
     name).  The user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using
     one of several methods depending on the protocol version used (see
     below).

     If command is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a
     login shell.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      Forces ssh to try protocol version 1 only.

     -2      Forces ssh to try protocol version 2 only.

     -4      Forces ssh to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces ssh to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A      Enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.  This
             can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration
             file.

             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
             agent's UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent through
             the forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material
             from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys
             that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into
             the agent.

     -a      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

     -b bind_address
             Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of
             the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than one
             address.

     -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,
             stderr, and data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections).  The
             compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the
             “level” can be controlled by the CompressionLevel option for pro‐
             tocol version 1.  Compression is desirable on modem lines and
             other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast
             networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis
             in the configuration files; see the Compression option.

     -c cipher_spec
             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

             Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher.  The
             supported values are “3des”, “blowfish”, and “des”.  3des
             (triple-des) is an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with three dif‐
             ferent keys.  It is believed to be secure.  blowfish is a fast
             block cipher; it appears very secure and is much faster than
             3des.  des is only supported in the ssh client for interoperabil‐
             ity with legacy protocol 1 implementations that do not support
             the 3des cipher.  Its use is strongly discouraged due to crypto‐
             graphic weaknesses.  The default is “3des”.

             For protocol version 2, cipher_spec is a comma-separated list of
             ciphers listed in order of preference.  See the Ciphers keyword
             in ssh_config(5) for more information.

     -D [bind_address:]port
             Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.
             This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local
             side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a
             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to
             determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently
             the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act
             as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.
             Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the configura‐
             tion file.

             IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in
             square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged
             ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with
             the GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may
             be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
             bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be
             bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates
             that the port should be available from all interfaces.

     -E log_file
             Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.

     -e escape_char
             Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).
             The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a
             line.  The escape character followed by a dot (‘.’) closes the
             connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and
             followed by itself sends the escape character once.  Setting the
             character to “none” disables any escapes and makes the session
             fully transparent.

     -F configfile
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a con‐
             figuration file is given on the command line, the system-wide
             configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config) will be ignored.  The
             default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.

     -f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.
             This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or
             passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This
             implies -n.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a
             remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm.

             If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to “yes”,
             then a client started with -f will wait for all remote port for‐
             wards to be successfully established before placing itself in the
             background.

     -g      Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.

     -I pkcs11
             Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate
             with a PKCS#11 token providing the user's private RSA key.

     -i identity_file
             Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public
             key authentication is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/identity for
             protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa,
             ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa for protocol version 2.
             Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in the
             configuration file.  It is possible to have multiple -i options
             (and multiple identities specified in configuration files).  ssh
             will also try to load certificate information from the filename
             obtained by appending -cert.pub to identity filenames.

     -K      Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation)
             of GSSAPI credentials to the server.

     -k      Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the
             server.

     -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
             Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be
             forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side.  This
             works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side,
             optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a con‐
             nection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port
             hostport from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be
             specified in the configuration file.  IPv6 addresses can be spec‐
             ified by enclosing the address in square brackets.  Only the
             superuser can forward privileged ports.  By default, the local
             port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts setting.  How‐
             ever, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection
             to a specific address.  The bind_address of “localhost” indicates
             that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an
             empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be available
             from all interfaces.

     -l login_name
             Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.  This also
             may be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.

     -M      Places the ssh client into “master” mode for connection sharing.
             Multiple -M options places ssh into “master” mode with confirma‐
             tion required before slave connections are accepted.  Refer to
             the description of ControlMaster in ssh_config(5) for details.

     -m mac_spec
             Additionally, for protocol version 2 a comma-separated list of
             MAC (message authentication code) algorithms can be specified in
             order of preference.  See the MACs keyword for more information.

     -N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just for‐
             warding ports (protocol version 2 only).

     -n      Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually, prevents reading from
             stdin).  This must be used when ssh is run in the background.

dbus-launch
It would normally be  called  from  a
       user's  login  scripts. Unlike the daemon itself, dbus-launch exits, so
       backticks or the $() construct can be used  to  read  information  from
       dbus-launch.

       With  no  arguments, dbus-launch will launch a session bus instance and
       print the address and PID of that instance to standard output.

       You may specify a program to be run; in  this  case,  dbus-launch  will
       launch  a  session  bus instance, set the appropriate environment vari‐
       ables so the specified program can find the bus, and then  execute  the
       specified  program,  with the specified arguments.  See below for exam‐
       ples.

       If you launch a program, dbus-launch will  not  print  the  information
       about the new bus to standard output.

       When  dbus-launch prints bus information to standard output, by default
       it is in a simple key-value pairs format. However, you may request sev‐
       eral   alternate   syntaxes   using   the   --sh-syntax,  --csh-syntax,
       --binary-syntax, or  --auto-syntax  options.  Several  of  these  cause
       dbus-launch to emit shell code to set up the environment.

       With  the  --auto-syntax  option, dbus-launch looks at the value of the
       SHELL environment variable to determine which shell  syntax  should  be
       used.   If  SHELL  ends  in "csh", then csh-compatible code is emitted;
       otherwise Bourne shell code is emitted.  Instead of passing --auto-syn‐
       tax,  you  may explicitly specify a particular one by using --sh-syntax
       for Bourne syntax, or --csh-syntax for csh syntax.   In  scripts,  it's
       more  robust  to avoid --auto-syntax and you hopefully know which shell
       your script is written in.

       about D-Bus. See also the man page for dbus-daemon.

x-window-manager
This is because the approach to its development was the
       opposite of what seems to be the general case for window managers.
       Openbox was written first to comply with standards and to work
       properly. Only when that was in place did the team turn to the visual
       interface.

       Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or
       can be used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in
       the GNOME or KDE desktop environments.

       Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based
       upon any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been
       based upon that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0
       codebase.

GNU find searches
       the directory tree rooted at each given file  name  by  evaluating  the
       given  expression  from left to right, according to the rules of prece‐
       dence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome  is  known  (the  left
       hand  side  is  false  for and operations, true for or), at which point
       find moves on to the next file name.

       If you are using find in an environment  where  security  is  important
       (for  example  if  you  are  using  it  to  search directories that are
       writable by other users), you should read the "Security Considerations"
       chapter  of  the findutils documentation, which is called Finding Files

pstruct
It was a perl
       program that tried to parse out C structures and display their member
       offsets for you.  This was especially useful for people looking at
       binary dumps or poking around the kernel.

       Pstruct was not a pretty program.  Neither was it particularly robust.
       The problem, you see, was that the C compiler was much better at
       parsing C than I could ever hope to be.

       So I got smart:  I decided to be lazy and let the C compiler parse the
       C, which would spit out debugger stabs for me to read.  These were much
       easier to parse.  It's still not a pretty program, but at least it's
       more robust.

       Pstruct takes any .c or .h files, or preferably .s ones, since that's
       the format it is going to massage them into anyway, and spits out
       listings like this:

ntpdc
The program may be run either in  inter‐
       active mode or controlled using command line arguments. Extensive state
       and statistics information is available through the ntpdc interface. In
       addition,  nearly  all the configuration options which can be specified
       at startup using ntpd's configuration file may also be specified at run
       time using ntpdc.

       If  one  or  more request options are included on the command line when
       ntpdc is executed, each of the requests will be sent to the NTP servers
       running  on  each  of  the hosts given as command line arguments, or on
       localhost by default. If no  request  options  are  given,  ntpdc  will
       attempt  to  read commands from the standard input and execute these on
       the NTP server running on the first host given  on  the  command  line,
       again  defaulting  to  localhost when no other host is specified. ntpdc
       will prompt for commands if the standard input is a terminal device.

       ntpdc uses NTP mode 7 packets to communicate with the NTP  server,  and
       hence  can  be used to query any compatible server on the network which
       permits it. Note that since NTP is a UDP  protocol  this  communication
       will  be  somewhat unreliable, especially over large distances in terms
       of network topology. ntpdc makes no attempt to retransmit requests, and
       will  time  requests  out if the remote host is not heard from within a
       suitable timeout time.

       The operation of ntpdc are specific to the particular implementation of
       the  ntpd  daemon  and can be expected to work only with this and maybe
       some previous versions of the daemon. Requests from a remote ntpdc pro‐
       gram  which affect the state of the local server must be authenticated,
       which requires both the remote program and local server share a  common
       key and key identifier.

       Note  that  in  contexts  where a host name is expected, a -4 qualifier
       preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to  the  IPv4  namespace,
       while a -6 qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace.

vi
It can be used
       to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful  for  editing
       programs.

       There  are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi win‐
       dows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line  editing,  filename
       completion,   on-line   help,   visual  selection,  etc..   See  ":help
       vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

       While running Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the  on-line  help
       system, with the ":help" command.  See the ON-LINE HELP section below.

       Most often Vim is started to edit a single file with the command

            vim file

       More generally Vim is started with:

            vim [options] [filelist]

       If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
       Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used  to  choose
       one or more files to be edited.

       file ..     A  list  of  filenames.   The first one will be the current
                   file and read into the buffer.  The cursor  will  be  posi‐
                   tioned on the first line of the buffer.  You can get to the
                   other files with the ":next" command.  To edit a file  that
                   starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "--".

       -           The  file  to  edit  is read from stdin.  Commands are read
                   from stderr, which should be a tty.

       -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on
                   a  "tag",  a sort of goto label.  {tag} is looked up in the
                   tags file, the associated file becomes the current file and
                   the  associated  command  is executed.  Mostly this is used
                   for C programs, in which case {tag}  could  be  a  function
                   name.  The effect is that the file containing that function
                   becomes the current file and the cursor  is  positioned  on
                   the start of the function.  See ":help tag-commands".

       -q [errorfile]
                   Start  in  quickFix mode.  The file [errorfile] is read and
                   the first error is displayed.  If [errorfile]  is  omitted,
                   the  filename  is  obtained  from  the  'errorfile'  option
                   (defaults to "AztecC.Err" for the  Amiga,  "errors.err"  on
                   other  systems).   Further errors can be jumped to with the
                   ":cn" command.  See ":help quickfix".

       Vim behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the exe‐
       cutable may still be the same file).

       vim       The "normal" way, everything is default.

       ex        Start  in Ex mode.  Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.
                 Can also be done with the "-e" argument.

       view      Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from  writing
                 the files.  Can also be done with the "-R" argument.

       gvim gview
                 The GUI version.  Starts a new window.  Can also be done with
                 the "-g" argument.

                 The GUI version in easy mode.  Starts a new window.  Can also
                 be done with the "-y" argument.

       rvim rview rgvim rgview
                 Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possi‐
                 ble to start shell commands, or suspend  Vim.   Can  also  be
                 done with the "-Z" argument.

       does not support enumeration).

       The database may be any of those supported by the GNU C Library, listed
       below:

          ahosts    When no key is provided, use sethostent(3), gethostent(3),
                    and endhostent(3) to enumerate the hosts  database.   This
                    is  identical  to using hosts.  When one or more key argu‐

                    drinfo(3)  with  the address family AF_UNSPEC, enumerating
                    each socket address structure returned.

          ahostsv4  Same as ahosts, but use the address family AF_INET.

          ahostsv6  Same as ahosts, but use the address family AF_INET6.   The
                    call   to   getaddrinfo(3)   in  this  case  includes  the
                    AI_V4MAPPED flag.

          aliases   When  no  key  is  provided,  use  setaliasent(3),  getal‐
                    iasent(3),  and  endaliasent(3)  to  enumerate the aliases
                    database.  When one or more key  arguments  are  provided,
                    pass  each key in succession to getaliasbyname(3) and dis‐
                    play the result.

          ethers    When one or more key arguments are provided, pass each key
                    in  succession to ether_aton(3) and ether_hostton(3) until
                    a result is obtained, and display the result.  Enumeration
                    is not supported on ethers, so a key must be provided.

          group     When no key is provided, use setgrent(3), getgrent(3), and
                    endgrent(3) to enumerate the group database.  When one  or
                    more  key arguments are provided, pass each numeric key to

                    display the result.

          gshadow   When no key is provided, use setsgent(3), getsgent(3), and
                    endsgent(3) to enumerate the gshadow database.   When  one
                    or  more key arguments are provided, pass each key in suc‐
                    cession to getsgnam(3) and display the result.

          hosts     When no key is provided, use sethostent(3), gethostent(3),
                    and  endhostent(3)  to enumerate the hosts database.  When
                    one or more key arguments are provided, pass each  key  to
                    gethostbyaddr(3)   or   gethostbyname2(3),   depending  on
                    whether a call to inet_pton(3) indicates that the  key  is
                    an IPv6 or IPv4 address or not, and display the result.

          initgroups
                    When one or more key arguments are provided, pass each key
                    in succession to getgrouplist(3) and display  the  result.
                    Enumeration  is not supported on initgroups, so a key must
                    be provided.

          netgroup  When one key is provided, pass the key  to  setnetgrent(3)
                    and,  using  getnetgrent(3)  display  the resulting string
                    triple (hostname, username,  domainname).   Alternatively,
                    three  keys  may be provided, which are interpreted as the
                    hostname, username and domainname to match to  a  netgroup
                    name via innetgr(3).  Enumeration is not supported on net‐
                    group, so either one or three keys must be provided.

          networks  When no key is provided, use  setnetent(3),  getnetent(3),
                    and endnetent(3) to enumerate the networks database.  When
                    one or more key arguments are provided, pass each  numeric
                    key  to getnetbyaddr(3) and each nonnumeric key to getnet‐
                    byname(3) and display the result.

          passwd    When no key is provided, use setpwent(3), getpwent(3), and
                    endpwent(3) to enumerate the passwd database.  When one or
                    more key arguments are provided, pass each numeric key  to
                    getpwuid(3)  and  each  nonnumeric  key to getpwnam(3) and
                    display the result.

          protocols When no  key  is  provided,  use  setprotoent(3),  getpro‐
                    toent(3),  and  endprotoent(3)  to enumerate the protocols
                    database.  When one or more key  arguments  are  provided,
                    pass each numeric key to getprotobynumber(3) and each non‐
                    numeric key to getprotobyname(3) and display the result.

          rpc       When no key is provided, use  setrpcent(3),  getrpcent(3),
                    and  endrpcent(3) to enumerate the rpc database.  When one

                    to  getrpcbynumber(3) and each nonnumeric key to getrpcby‐
                    name(3) and display the result.

          services  When no key is provided, use setservent(3), getservent(3),
                    and  endservent(3)  to  enumerate  the  services database.

less
Less  does  not  have to read the entire input file before starting, so
       with large input files it starts up faster than text  editors  like  vi
       (1).  Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on
       a variety of terminals.  There is even  limited  support  for  hardcopy
       terminals.   (On  a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at
       the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)

       Commands are based on both more and vi.  Commands may be preceded by  a
       decimal number, called N in the descriptions below.  The number is used
       by some commands, as indicated.

perl5.18.2
Perl was originally a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text
       files, extracting information from those text files, and printing
       reports based on that information.  It quickly became a good language
       for many system management tasks. Over the years, Perl has grown into a
       general-purpose programming language. It's widely used for everything
       from quick "one-liners" to full-scale application development.

       The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
       complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).  It combines
       (in the author's opinion, anyway) some of the best features of sed,
       awk, and sh, making it familiar and easy to use for Unix users to whip
       up quick solutions to annoying problems.  Its general-purpose
       programming facilities support procedural, functional, and object-
       oriented programming paradigms, making Perl a comfortable language for
       the long haul on major projects, whatever your bent.

       Perl's roots in text processing haven't been forgotten over the years.
       It still boasts some of the most powerful regular expressions to be
       found anywhere, and its support for Unicode text is world-class.  It
       handles all kinds of structured text, too, through an extensive
       collection of extensions.  Those libraries, collected in the CPAN,
       provide ready-made solutions to an astounding array of problems.  When
       they haven't set the standard themselves, they steal from the best --
       just like Perl itself.

nawk
The AWK lan‐
       guage is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and pro‐
       cessing,  and  for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms.  mawk
       is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in  Aho,
       Kernighan  and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
       Publishing, 1988.  (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.)  mawk  con‐
       forms  to  the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
       which contains a few features not described in the AWK book,  and  mawk
       provides a small number of extensions.

       An  AWK  program  is  a sequence of pattern {action} pairs and function
       definitions.  Short programs are entered on the  command  line  usually
       enclosed  in ' ' to avoid shell interpretation.  Longer programs can be
       read in from a file with the -f option.  Data  input is read  from  the
       list  of files on the command line or from standard input when the list
       is empty.  The input is broken into records as determined by the record
       separator  variable,  RS.  Initially, RS = "\n" and records are synony‐
       mous with lines.  Each record is compared against each pattern  and  if
       it matches, the program text for {action} is executed.

ssh
It is intended to replace rlogin
     and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between two
     untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary
     TCP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     ssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user
     name).  The user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using
     one of several methods depending on the protocol version used (see
     below).

     If command is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a
     login shell.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      Forces ssh to try protocol version 1 only.

     -2      Forces ssh to try protocol version 2 only.

     -4      Forces ssh to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces ssh to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A      Enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.  This
             can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration
             file.

             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
             agent's UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent through
             the forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material
             from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys
             that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into
             the agent.

     -a      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

     -b bind_address
             Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of
             the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than one
             address.

     -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,
             stderr, and data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections).  The
             compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the
             “level” can be controlled by the CompressionLevel option for pro‐
             tocol version 1.  Compression is desirable on modem lines and
             other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast
             networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis
             in the configuration files; see the Compression option.

     -c cipher_spec
             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

             Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher.  The
             supported values are “3des”, “blowfish”, and “des”.  3des
             (triple-des) is an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with three dif‐
             ferent keys.  It is believed to be secure.  blowfish is a fast
             block cipher; it appears very secure and is much faster than
             3des.  des is only supported in the ssh client for interoperabil‐
             ity with legacy protocol 1 implementations that do not support
             the 3des cipher.  Its use is strongly discouraged due to crypto‐
             graphic weaknesses.  The default is “3des”.

             For protocol version 2, cipher_spec is a comma-separated list of
             ciphers listed in order of preference.  See the Ciphers keyword
             in ssh_config(5) for more information.

     -D [bind_address:]port
             Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.
             This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local
             side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a
             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to
             determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently
             the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act
             as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.
             Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the configura‐
             tion file.

             IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in
             square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged
             ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with
             the GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may
             be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
             bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be
             bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates
             that the port should be available from all interfaces.

     -E log_file
             Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.

     -e escape_char
             Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).
             The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a
             line.  The escape character followed by a dot (‘.’) closes the
             connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and
             followed by itself sends the escape character once.  Setting the
             character to “none” disables any escapes and makes the session
             fully transparent.

     -F configfile
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a con‐
             figuration file is given on the command line, the system-wide
             configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config) will be ignored.  The
             default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.

     -f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.
             This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or
             passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This
             implies -n.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a
             remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm.

             If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to “yes”,
             then a client started with -f will wait for all remote port for‐
             wards to be successfully established before placing itself in the
             background.

     -g      Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.

     -I pkcs11
             Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate
             with a PKCS#11 token providing the user's private RSA key.

     -i identity_file
             Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public
             key authentication is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/identity for
             protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa,
             ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa for protocol version 2.
             Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in the
             configuration file.  It is possible to have multiple -i options
             (and multiple identities specified in configuration files).  ssh
             will also try to load certificate information from the filename
             obtained by appending -cert.pub to identity filenames.

     -K      Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation)
             of GSSAPI credentials to the server.

     -k      Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the
             server.

     -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
             Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be
             forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side.  This
             works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side,
             optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a con‐
             nection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port
             hostport from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be
             specified in the configuration file.  IPv6 addresses can be spec‐
             ified by enclosing the address in square brackets.  Only the
             superuser can forward privileged ports.  By default, the local
             port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts setting.  How‐
             ever, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection
             to a specific address.  The bind_address of “localhost” indicates
             that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an
             empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be available
             from all interfaces.

     -l login_name
             Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.  This also
             may be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.

     -M      Places the ssh client into “master” mode for connection sharing.
             Multiple -M options places ssh into “master” mode with confirma‐
             tion required before slave connections are accepted.  Refer to
             the description of ControlMaster in ssh_config(5) for details.

     -m mac_spec
             Additionally, for protocol version 2 a comma-separated list of
             MAC (message authentication code) algorithms can be specified in
             order of preference.  See the MACs keyword for more information.

     -N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just for‐
             warding ports (protocol version 2 only).

     -n      Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually, prevents reading from
             stdin).  This must be used when ssh is run in the background.

jdb
It is a demonstration of the Java Platform Debugger Architec‐
       ture @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/index.html
       that provides inspection and debugging of a local or remote Java Vir‐
       tual Machine.

   Starting a jdb Session
       There are many ways to start a jdb session. The most frequently used
       way is to have jdb launch a new Java Virtual Machine (VM) with the main
       class of the application to be debugged. This is done by substituting
       the command jdb for java in the command line. For example, if your
       application's main class is MyClass, you use the following command to
       debug it under JDB:

        % jdb MyClass


       When started this way, jdb invokes a second Java VM with any specified
       parameters, loads the specified class, and stops the VM before execut‐
       ing that class's first instruction.

       Another way to use jdb is by attaching it to a Java VM that is already
       running. Syntax for Starting a VM to which jdb will attach when the

Several "front-end" interfaces exist, such as aptitude(8), synaptic(8)
       and wajig(1).

       Unless the -h, or --help option is given, one of the commands below
       must be present.

       update
           update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their
           sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the
           location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list. For example, when
           using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and scans the
           Packages.gz files, so that information about new and updated
           packages is available. An update should always be performed before
           an upgrade or dist-upgrade. Please be aware that the overall
           progress meter will be incorrect as the size of the package files
           cannot be known in advance.

       upgrade
           upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages
           currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in
           /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new
           versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no
           circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages
           not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of
           currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without
           changing the install status of another package will be left at
           their current version. An update must be performed first so that
           apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.

       dist-upgrade
           dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,
           also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions
           of packages; apt-get has a "smart" conflict resolution system, and
           it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the
           expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade
           command may therefore remove some packages. The
           /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which
           to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for
           a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual
           packages.

       dselect-upgrade
           dselect-upgrade is used in conjunction with the traditional Debian
           packaging front-end, dselect(1).  dselect-upgrade follows the
           changes made by dselect(1) to the Status field of available
           packages, and performs the actions necessary to realize that state
           (for instance, the removal of old and the installation of new
           packages).

       install
           install is followed by one or more packages desired for
           installation or upgrading. Each package is a package name, not a
           fully qualified filename (for instance, in a Debian system,
           apt-utils would be the argument provided, not
           apt-utils_1.0.1ubuntu2_amd64.deb). All packages required by the
           package(s) specified for installation will also be retrieved and
           installed. The /etc/apt/sources.list file is used to locate the
           desired packages. If a hyphen is appended to the package name (with
           no intervening space), the identified package will be removed if it
           is installed. Similarly a plus sign can be used to designate a
           package to install. These latter features may be used to override
           decisions made by apt-get's conflict resolution system.

           A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by
           following the package name with an equals and the version of the
           package to select. This will cause that version to be located and
           selected for install. Alternatively a specific distribution can be
           selected by following the package name with a slash and the version
           of the distribution or the Archive name (stable, testing,
           unstable).

           Both of the version selection mechanisms can downgrade packages and
           must be used with care.

           This is also the target to use if you want to upgrade one or more
           already-installed packages without upgrading every package you have
           on your system. Unlike the "upgrade" target, which installs the
           newest version of all currently installed packages, "install" will
           install the newest version of only the package(s) specified. Simply
           provide the name of the package(s) you wish to upgrade, and if a
           newer version is available, it (and its dependencies, as described
           above) will be downloaded and installed.

           Finally, the apt_preferences(5) mechanism allows you to create an
           alternative installation policy for individual packages.

GNU find searches
       the directory tree rooted at each given file  name  by  evaluating  the

       find moves on to the next file name.

       If you are using find in an environment  where  security  is  important
       (for  example  if  you  are  using  it  to  search directories that are

Resize determines the command through several steps:

       ·   first, it finds the name of the user's shell program.  It uses  the
           SHELL  variable  if  set,  otherwise  it  uses the user's data from
           /etc/passwd.

       ·   then it decides whether to use Bourne shell syntax or C-Shell  syn‐
           tax.   It uses a built-in table of known shells, which can be over‐
           ridden by the -u and -c options.

       ·   then resize asks the operating system for  the  terminal  settings.
           This is the same information which can be manipulated using stty.

       ·   then  resize asks the terminal for its size in characters.  Depend‐
           ing on whether the "-s option is given,  resize  uses  a  different
           escape sequence to ask for this information.

       ·   at  this  point, resize attempts to update the terminal settings to
           reflect the terminal window's size in pixels:

           ·   if the -s option is used, resize then asks the terminal for its
               size in pixels.

           ·   otherwise, resize asks the operating system for the information
               and updates that after ensuring that  the  window's  dimensions
               are a multiple of the character height and width.

           ·   in  either case, the updated terminal settings are done using a
               different system call than used for stty.

       ·   then resize updates the terminal settings to  reflect  any  altered
           values  such as its size in rows or columns.  This affects the val‐
           ues shown by stty.

       ·   finally, resize writes the shell command for setting  the  environ‐
           ment variables to the standard output.

passwd
A normal user
       may only change the password for his/her own account, while the
       superuser may change the password for any account.  passwd also changes
       the account or associated password validity period.

   Password Changes
       The user is first prompted for his/her old password, if one is present.
       This password is then encrypted and compared against the stored
       password. The user has only one chance to enter the correct password.
       The superuser is permitted to bypass this step so that forgotten
       passwords may be changed.

       After the password has been entered, password aging information is
       checked to see if the user is permitted to change the password at this
       time. If not, passwd refuses to change the password and exits.

       The user is then prompted twice for a replacement password. The second
       entry is compared against the first and both are required to match in
       order for the password to be changed.

       Then, the password is tested for complexity. As a general guideline,
       passwords should consist of 6 to 8 characters including one or more
       characters from each of the following sets:

       ·   lower case alphabetics

       ·   digits 0 thru 9

       ·   punctuation marks

       Care must be taken not to include the system default erase or kill
       characters.  passwd will reject any password which is not suitably
       complex.

   Hints for user passwords
       The security of a password depends upon the strength of the encryption
       algorithm and the size of the key space. The legacy UNIX System
       encryption method is based on the NBS DES algorithm. More recent
       methods are now recommended (see ENCRYPT_METHOD). The size of the key
       space depends upon the randomness of the password which is selected.

       Compromises in password security normally result from careless password
       selection or handling. For this reason, you should not select a
       password which appears in a dictionary or which must be written down.
       The password should also not be a proper name, your license number,
       birth date, or street address. Any of these may be used as guesses to
       violate system security.

       You can find advices on how to choose a strong password on
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength

There are  some  similarities  in  the

       defined before processing any files.  bc starts by processing code from
       all the files listed on the command line in the  order  listed.   After
       all  files  have been processed, bc reads from the standard input.  All
       code is executed as it is read.  (If a file contains a command to  halt
       the processor, bc will never read from the standard input.)

       This  version  of  bc contains several extensions beyond traditional bc
       implementations and the POSIX draft standard.  Command line options can
       cause these extensions to print a warning or to be rejected.  This doc‐

perlthanks
In most cases, you can just run it interactively from a command line
       without any special arguments and follow the prompts.

       If you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one that was not part
       of the standard distribution), a binary distribution, or a non-core
       module (such as Tk, DBI, etc), then please see the documentation that
       came with that distribution to determine the correct place to report
       bugs.

       If you are unable to send your report using perlbug (most likely
       because your system doesn't have a way to send mail that perlbug
       recognizes), you may be able to use this tool to compose your report
       and save it to a file which you can then send to perlbug@perl.org using
       your regular mail client.

       In extreme cases, perlbug may not work well enough on your system to
       guide you through composing a bug report. In those cases, you may be
       able to use perlbug -d to get system configuration information to
       include in a manually composed bug report to perlbug@perl.org.

       When reporting a bug, please run through this checklist:

       What version of Perl you are running?
           Type "perl -v" at the command line to find out.

       Are you running the latest released version of perl?
           Look at http://www.perl.org/ to find out.  If you are not using the
           latest released version, please try to replicate your bug on the
           latest stable release.

           Note that reports about bugs in old versions of Perl, especially
           those which indicate you haven't also tested the current stable
           release of Perl, are likely to receive less attention from the
           volunteers who build and maintain Perl than reports about bugs in
           the current release.

           This tool isn't appropriate for reporting bugs in any version prior
           to Perl 5.0.

       Are you sure what you have is a bug?
           A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to be
           documented features in Perl.  Make sure the issue you've run into
           isn't intentional by glancing through the documentation that comes
           with the Perl distribution.

           Given the sheer volume of Perl documentation, this isn't a trivial
           undertaking, but if you can point to documentation that suggests
           the behaviour you're seeing is wrong, your issue is likely to
           receive more attention. You may want to start with perldoc perltrap
           for pointers to common traps that new (and experienced) Perl
           programmers run into.

           If you're unsure of the meaning of an error message you've run
           across, perldoc perldiag for an explanation.  If the message isn't
           in perldiag, it probably isn't generated by Perl.  You may have
           luck consulting your operating system documentation instead.

           If you are on a non-UNIX platform perldoc perlport, as some
           features may be unimplemented or work differently.

           You may be able to figure out what's going wrong using the Perl
           debugger.  For information about how to use the debugger perldoc
           perldebug.

       Do you have a proper test case?
           The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be
           fixed -- if nobody can duplicate your problem, it probably won't be
           addressed.

           A good test case has most of these attributes: short, simple code;
           few dependencies on external commands, modules, or libraries; no
           platform-dependent code (unless it's a platform-specific bug);
           clear, simple documentation.

           A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be included
           in Perl's test suite.  If you have the time, consider writing your
           test case so that it can be easily included into the standard test
           suite.

       Have you included all relevant information?
           Be sure to include the exact error messages, if any.  "Perl gave an
           error" is not an exact error message.

           If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a debugger
           (dbx, gdb, etc) to produce a stack trace to include in the bug
           report.

           NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info (often
           -g), the stack trace is likely to be somewhat hard to use because
           it will most probably contain only the function names and not their
           arguments.  If possible, recompile your Perl with debug info and
           reproduce the crash and the stack trace.

       Can you describe the bug in plain English?
           The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely
           it will be fixed.  Any insight you can provide into the problem
           will help a great deal.  In other words, try to analyze the problem
           (to the extent you can) and report your discoveries.

       Can you fix the bug yourself?
           A bug report which includes a patch to fix it will almost
           definitely be fixed.  When sending a patch, please use the "diff"
           program with the "-u" option to generate "unified" diff files.  Bug
           reports with patches are likely to receive significantly more
           attention and interest than those without patches.

           Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or requests
           for more detailed explanations about your fix.

           Here are a few hints for creating high-quality patches:

           Make sure the patch is not reversed (the first argument to diff is
           typically the original file, the second argument your changed
           file).  Make sure you test your patch by applying it with the
           "patch" program before you send it on its way.  Try to follow the
           same style as the code you are trying to patch.  Make sure your
           patch really does work ("make test", if the thing you're patching
           is covered by Perl's test suite).

       Can you use "perlbug" to submit the report?
           perlbug will, amongst other things, ensure your report includes
           crucial information about your version of perl.  If "perlbug" is
           unable to mail your report after you have typed it in, you may have
           to compose the message yourself, add the output produced by
           "perlbug -d" and email it to perlbug@perl.org.  If, for some
           reason, you cannot run "perlbug" at all on your system, be sure to
           include the entire output produced by running "perl -V" (note the
           uppercase V).

           Whether you use "perlbug" or send the email manually, please make
           your Subject line informative.  "a bug" is not informative.
           Neither is "perl crashes" nor is "HELP!!!".  These don't help.

       stdin.  The content of the response is printed on stdout.  Error
       messages are printed on stderr.  The program returns a status value
       indicating the number of URLs that failed.

       The options are:

       -m <method>
           Set which method to use for the request.  If this option is not
           used, then the method is derived from the name of the program.

       -f  Force request through, even if the program believes that the method
           is illegal.  The server might reject the request eventually.

       -b <uri>
           This URI will be used as the base URI for resolving all relative
           URIs given as argument.

       -t <timeout>
           Set the timeout value for the requests.  The timeout is the amount
           of time that the program will wait for a response from the remote
           server before it fails.  The default unit for the timeout value is
           seconds.  You might append "m" or "h" to the timeout value to make
           it minutes or hours, respectively.  The default timeout is '3m',
           i.e. 3 minutes.

       -i <time>
           Set the If-Modified-Since header in the request. If time is the
           name of a file, use the modification timestamp for this file. If
           time is not a file, it is parsed as a literal date. Take a look at
           HTTP::Date for recognized formats.

       -c <content-type>
           Set the Content-Type for the request.  This option is only allowed
           for requests that take a content, i.e. POST and PUT.  You can force
           methods to take content by using the "-f" option together with
           "-c".  The default Content-Type for POST is
           "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".  The default Content-type for
           the others is "text/plain".

       -p <proxy-url>
           Set the proxy to be used for the requests.  The program also loads
           proxy settings from the environment.  You can disable this with the
           "-P" option.

       -P  Don't load proxy settings from environment.

       -H <header>
           Send this HTTP header with each request. You can specify several,
           e.g.:

               lwp-request \
                   -H 'Referer: http://other.url/' \
                   -H 'Host: somehost' \
                   http://this.url/

       -C <username>:<password>
           Provide credentials for documents that are protected by Basic
           Authentication.  If the document is protected and you did not
           specify the username and password with this option, then you will
           be prompted to provide these values.

       The following options controls what is displayed by the program:

       -u  Print request method and absolute URL as requests are made.

       -U  Print request headers in addition to request method and absolute
           URL.

       -s  Print response status code.  This option is always on for

ssh-copy-id
It
     assembles a list of one or more fingerprints (as described below) and
     tries to log in with each key, to see if any of them are already
     installed (of course, if you are not using ssh-agent(1) this may result
     in you being repeatedly prompted for pass-phrases).  It then assembles a
     list of those that failed to log in, and using ssh, enables logins with
     those keys on the remote server.  By default it adds the keys by append‐
     ing them to the remote user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (creating the file,
     and directory, if necessary).  It is also capable of detecting if the
     remote system is a NetScreen, and using its ‘set ssh pka-dsa key ...’
     command instead.

     The options are as follows:

     -i identity_file
             Use only the key(s) contained in identity_file (rather than look‐
             ing for identities via ssh-add(1) or in the default_ID_file).  If
             the filename does not end in .pub this is added.  If the filename
             is omitted, the default_ID_file is used.

             Note that this can be used to ensure that the keys copied have
             the comment one prefers and/or extra options applied, by ensuring
             that the key file has these set as preferred before the copy is
             attempted.

     -n      do a dry-run.  Instead of installing keys on the remote system
             simply prints the key(s) that would have been installed.

     -h, -?  Print Usage summary

     -p port, -o ssh_option
             These two options are simply passed through untouched, along with
             their argument, to allow one to set the port or other ssh(1)
             options, respectively.

             Rather than specifying these as command line options, it is often
             better to use (per-host) settings in ssh(1)'s configuration file:
             ssh_config(5).

     Default behaviour without -i, is to check if ‘ssh-add -L’ provides any
     output, and if so those keys are used.  Note that this results in the
     comment on the key being the filename that was given to ssh-add(1) when
     the key was loaded into your ssh-agent(1) rather than the comment con‐
     tained in that file, which is a bit of a shame.  Otherwise, if ssh-add(1)
     provides no keys contents of the default_ID_file will be used.

     The default_ID_file is the most recent file that matches: ~/.ssh/id*.pub,
     (excluding those that match ~/.ssh/*-cert.pub) so if you create a key
     that is not the one you want ssh-copy-id to use, just use touch(1) on
     your preferred key's .pub file to reinstate it as the most recent.

resizecons
There are several aspects to this: (a) the kernel must know  about  it,
       (b)  the hardware must know about it, (c) user programs must know about
       it, (d) the console font may have to be adapted.

       (a) The kernel is told about the  change  using  the  ioctl  VT_RESIZE.
       This causes the kernel to reallocate console screen memory for all vir‐
       tual consoles, and might fail if there is not enough memory.  (In  that
       case,  try  to disallocate some virtual consoles first.)  If this ioctl
       succeeds, but a later step fails (e.g., because you do  not  have  root
       permissions), you may be left with a very messy screen.

       The  most  difficult  part  of  this is (b), since it requires detailed
       knowledge of the video card hardware, and the setting of numerous  reg‐
       isters.  Only  changing  the  number  of  rows  is slightly easier, and
       resizecons will try to do that itself, when given  the  -lines  option.
       (Probably,  root  permission will be required.)  The command resizecons
       COLSxROWS will execute restoretextmode -r COLSxROWS (and hence requires
       that  you  have  svgalib  installed). Here COLSxROWS is a file that was
       created earlier by restoretextmode -w COLSxROWS.   Again,  either  root
       permissions are required, or restoretextmode has to be suid root.

       In order to deal with (c), resizecons does a `stty rows ROWS cols COLS'
       for each active console (in the range tty0..tty15), and  sends  a  SIG‐
       WINCH signal to selection if it finds the file /tmp/selection.pid.

       Finally, (d) is dealt with by executing a setfont command. Most likely,
       the wrong font is loaded, and you may want to do another setfont  your‐
       self afterwards.

patch
Normally the patched ver‐
       sions are put in place of the originals.  Backups can be made; see  the
       -b  or  --backup option.  The names of the files to be patched are usu‐
       ally taken from the patch file, but if there's  just  one  file  to  be
       patched it can be specified on the command line as originalfile.

       Upon startup, patch attempts to determine the type of the diff listing,
       unless overruled by a -c (--context), -e (--ed), -n (--normal),  or  -u
       (--unified)  option.  Context diffs (old-style, new-style, and unified)
       and normal diffs are applied by the  patch  program  itself,  while  ed
       diffs are simply fed to the ed(1) editor via a pipe.

       patch  tries to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff, and then skip
       any trailing garbage.  Thus you could feed an article or  message  con‐
       taining  a  diff  listing  to patch, and it should work.  If the entire
       diff is indented by a consistent amount, if lines end in CRLF, or if  a
       diff  is  encapsulated  one  or  more times by prepending "- " to lines
       starting with "-" as specified by Internet RFC 934, this is taken  into
       account.   After  removing  indenting or encapsulation, lines beginning
       with # are ignored, as they are considered to be comments.

       With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs, patch can
       detect  when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and
       attempts to find the correct place to apply each hunk of the patch.  As
       a first guess, it takes the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus or
       minus any offset used in applying the previous hunk.  If  that  is  not
       the correct place, patch scans both forwards and backwards for a set of
       lines matching the context given in the hunk.  First patch looks for  a
       place where all lines of the context match.  If no such place is found,
       and it's a context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is  set  to  1  or
       more, then another scan takes place ignoring the first and last line of
       context.  If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is  set  to  2  or
       more,  the  first  two  and  last two lines of context are ignored, and
       another scan is made.  (The default maximum fuzz factor is 2.)

       Hunks with less prefix context  than  suffix  context  (after  applying
       fuzz)  must  apply  at the start of the file if their first line number
       is 1.  Hunks with more prefix context than suffix context (after apply‐
       ing fuzz) must apply at the end of the file.

       If patch cannot find a place to install that hunk of the patch, it puts
       the hunk out to a reject file, which normally is the name of the output
       file  plus  a .rej suffix, or # if .rej would generate a file name that
       is too long (if even appending the single character #  makes  the  file
       name too long, then # replaces the file name's last character).

       The  rejected hunk comes out in unified or context diff format.  If the
       input was a normal diff, many of the contexts  are  simply  null.   The
       line  numbers  on the hunks in the reject file may be different than in
       the patch file: they reflect the approximate location patch thinks  the
       failed hunks belong in the new file rather than the old one.

       As  each  hunk is completed, you are told if the hunk failed, and if so
       which line (in the new file) patch thought the hunk should go  on.   If
       the  hunk  is installed at a different line from the line number speci‐
       fied in the diff, you are told the offset.  A single large  offset  may
       indicate  that  a  hunk was installed in the wrong place.  You are also
       told if a fuzz factor was used to make the match,  in  which  case  you
       should  also be slightly suspicious.  If the --verbose option is given,
       you are also told about hunks that match exactly.

       If no original file origfile is specified on the  command  line,  patch
       tries  to figure out from the leading garbage what the name of the file
       to edit is, using the following rules.

       First, patch takes an ordered list of candidate file names as follows:

        · If the header is that of a context diff, patch takes the old and new
          file  names  in  the  header.  A name is ignored if it does not have
          enough slashes to satisfy the -pnum or --strip=num option.  The name
          /dev/null is also ignored.

        · If  there is an Index: line in the leading garbage and if either the
          old and new names are both absent  or  if  patch  is  conforming  to
          POSIX, patch takes the name in the Index: line.

        · For the purpose of the following rules, the candidate file names are
          considered to be in the order (old, new, index), regardless  of  the
          order that they appear in the header.

       Then patch selects a file name from the candidate list as follows:

        · If  some  of  the named files exist, patch selects the first name if
          conforming to POSIX, and the best name otherwise.

        · If patch is not ignoring RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, and SCCS (see the
          -g num  or  --get=num  option), and no named files exist but an RCS,
          ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master  is  found,  patch  selects  the
          first named file with an RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master.

        · If no named files exist, no RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master
          was found, some names are given, patch is not conforming  to  POSIX,
          and  the patch appears to create a file, patch selects the best name
          requiring the creation of the fewest directories.

        · If no file name results from the above heuristics, you are asked for
          the name of the file to patch, and patch selects that name.

       To  determine  the  best  of a nonempty list of file names, patch first
       takes all the names with the fewest path name components; of those,  it
       then  takes all the names with the shortest basename; of those, it then
       takes all the shortest names; finally, it  takes  the  first  remaining
       name.

       Additionally,  if  the  leading  garbage contains a Prereq: line, patch
       takes the first word from the prerequisites line  (normally  a  version
       number)  and checks the original file to see if that word can be found.
       If not, patch asks for confirmation before proceeding.

       The upshot of all this is that you should be able to say,  while  in  a
       news interface, something like the following:

          | patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl

       and patch a file in the blurfl directory directly from the article con‐
       taining the patch.

       If the patch file contains more than one patch, patch  tries  to  apply
       each  of  them  as if they came from separate patch files.  This means,
       among other things, that it is assumed that the name  of  the  file  to
       patch  must  be  determined for each diff listing, and that the garbage
       before each diff listing contains interesting things such as file names
       and revision level, as mentioned previously.

       specified with a toolkit option.  For example,

            % appres  Xman.TopLevelShell.Form  xman.topBox.form

       will list the resources of widgets of xman topBox hierarchy.   To  list
       just  the resources matching a specific level in the hierarchy, use the
       -1 option.  For example,

            % appres  XTerm.VT100  xterm.vt100  -1

       will list the resources matching the xterm vt100 widget.

       The -V option prints the appres command version and exits.

jarsigner
· To verify the signatures and integrity of signed JAR files.

       The JAR feature enables the packaging of class files, images, sounds,
       and other digital data in a single file for faster and easier
       distribution. A tool named jar enables developers to produce JAR files.
       (Technically, any zip file can also be considered a JAR file, although
       when created by the jar command or processed by the jarsigner command,
       JAR files also contain a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file.)

       A digital signature is a string of bits that is computed from some data
       (the data being signed) and the private key of an entity (a person,
       company, and so on). Similar to a handwritten signature, a digital
       signature has many useful characteristics:

       · Its authenticity can be verified by a computation that uses the
         public key corresponding to the private key used to generate the
         signature.

       · It cannot be forged, assuming the private key is kept secret.

       · It is a function of the data signed and thus cannot be claimed to be
         the signature for other data as well.

       · The signed data cannot be changed. If the data is changed, then the
         signature cannot be verified as authentic.

       To generate an entity's signature for a file, the entity must first
       have a public/private key pair associated with it and one or more
       certificates that authenticate its public key. A certificate is a
       digitally signed statement from one entity that says that the public
       key of another entity has a particular value.

       The jarsigner command uses key and certificate information from a
       keystore to generate digital signatures for JAR files. A keystore is a
       database of private keys and their associated X.509 certificate chains
       that authenticate the corresponding public keys. The keytool command is
       used to create and administer keystores.

       The jarsigner command uses an entity's private key to generate a
       signature. The signed JAR file contains, among other things, a copy of
       the certificate from the keystore for the public key corresponding to
       the private key used to sign the file. The jarsigner command can verify
       the digital signature of the signed JAR file using the certificate
       inside it (in its signature block file).

       The jarsigner command can generate signatures that include a time stamp
       that lets a systems or deployer (including Java Plug-in) to check
       whether the JAR file was signed while the signing certificate was still
       valid. In addition, APIs allow applications to obtain the timestamp
       information.

       At this time, the jarsigner command can only sign JAR files created by
       the jar command or zip files. JAR files are the same as zip files,
       except they also have a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file. A META-
       INF/MANIFEST.MF file is created when the jarsigner command signs a zip
       file.

       The default jarsigner command behavior is to sign a JAR or zip file.
       Use the -verify option to verify a signed JAR file.

       The jarsigner command also attempts to validate the signer's
       certificate after signing or verifying. If there is a validation error
       or any other problem, the command generates warning messages. If you
       specify the -strict option, then the command treats severe warnings as
       errors. See Errors and Warnings.

     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -o option, display
             date of Orthodox Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -m month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal
             number, it may be followed by the letter ‘f’ or ‘p’ to indicate
             the following or preceding month of that number, respectively.

     -o      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox
             Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Grego‐
             rian Calendar as they are assumed by ncal.  The country code as
             determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date
             associated with the country_code.  If not specified, ncal tries
             to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back
             to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her
             colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

     -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied
             when a year but no month are specified on the command line.

     -3      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     -1      Display only the current month. This is the default.

     -A number
             Months to add after. The specified number of months is added to
             the end of the display. This is in addition to any date range
             selected by the -y, -3, or -1 options. For example, “cal -y -B2
             -A2” shows everything from November of the previous year to Feb‐
             ruary of the following year. Negative numbers are allowed, in
             which case the specified number of months is subtracted. For
             example, “cal -y -B-6” shows July to December. And “cal -A11”
             simply shows the next 12 months.

     -B number
             Months to add before. The specified number of months is added to
             the beginning of the display. See -A for examples.

     -C      Switch to cal mode.

     -N      Switch to ncal mode.

     -d yyyy-mm
             Use yyyy-mm as the current date (for debugging of date selec‐
             tion).

     -H yyyy-mm-dd
             Use yyyy-mm-dd as the current date (for debugging of highlight‐
             ing).

     -M      Weeks start on Monday.

     -S      Weeks start on Sunday.

     -b      Use oldstyle format for ncal output.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1–9999) to be displayed; note the
     year must be fully specified: “cal 89” will not display a calendar for
     1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a
     number between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by
     the current locale.  Month and year default to those of the current sys‐
     tem clock and time zone (so “cal -m 8” will display a calendar for the
     month of August in the current year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example, the options -y, -3,
     and -1 are mutually exclusive. If inconsistent options are given, the
     later ones take precedence over the earlier ones.

     A year starts on January 1.

ghostscript
gs reads "files" in sequence and executes them as
       Ghostscript programs. After doing this, it reads further input from the
       standard input stream (normally the keyboard), interpreting  each  line
       separately and output to an output device (may be a file or an X11 win‐
       dow preview, see below).  The  interpreter  exits  gracefully  when  it
       encounters  the "quit" command (either in a file or from the keyboard),
       at end-of-file, or at an interrupt signal (such  as  Control-C  at  the
       keyboard).

       The  interpreter  recognizes  many  option  switches, some of which are
       described below. Please see the usage documentation for complete infor‐
       mation.  Switches  may appear anywhere in the command line and apply to
       all files thereafter.  Invoking Ghostscript with the -h  or  -?  switch
       produces a message which shows several useful switches, all the devices
       known to that executable, and the search path for  fonts;  on  Unix  it
       also shows the location of detailed documentation.

       Ghostscript  may be built to use many different output devices.  To see
       which devices your executable includes, run "gs -h".

       Unless you specify a particular device, Ghostscript normally opens  the
       first one of those and directs output to it.

       If  built  with  X11 support, often the default device is an X11 window
       (previewer), else ghostscript will typically use the  bbox  device  and
       print on stdout the dimension of the postscript file.

       So  if the first one in the list is the one you want to use, just issue
       the command

            gs myfile.ps

       You can also check the set of  available  devices  from  within  Ghost‐
       script: invoke Ghostscript and type

            devicenames ==

       but  the  first  device  on  the  resulting list may not be the default
       device you determine with "gs -h".  To specify "AbcXyz" as the  initial
       output device, include the switch

            -sDEVICE=AbcXyz

       For example, for output to an Epson printer you might use the command

            gs -sDEVICE=epson myfile.ps

       The  "-sDEVICE="  switch  must  precede  the first mention of a file to
       print, and only the switch's first use has any effect.

       Finally, you can specify a default device in the  environment  variable
       GS_DEVICE.  The order of precedence for these alternatives from highest
       to lowest (Ghostscript uses the device defined highest in the list) is:

       Some devices can support different resolutions (densities).  To specify
       the resolution on such a printer, use the "-r" switch:

            gs -sDEVICE=<device> -r<xres>x<yres>

       For  example,  on a 9-pin Epson-compatible printer, you get the lowest-
       density (fastest) mode with

            gs -sDEVICE=epson -r60x72

       and the highest-density (best output quality) mode with

            gs -sDEVICE=epson -r240x72.

       If you select a printer as the output device, Ghostscript  also  allows
       you  to  choose  where Ghostscript sends the output -- on Unix systems,
       usually to a temporary file.  To send the output to a  file  "foo.xyz",
       use the switch

            -sOutputFile=foo.xyz

       You  might  want  to  print each page separately.  To do this, send the
       output to a series of files "foo1.xyz, foo2.xyz, ..." using the "-sOut‐
       putFile=" switch with "%d" in a filename template:

            -sOutputFile=foo%d.xyz

       Each resulting file receives one page of output, and the files are num‐
       bered in sequence.  "%d" is a printf format specification; you can also
       use a variant like "%02d".

       On Unix and MS Windows systems you can also send output to a pipe.  For
       example, to pipe output to the "lpr" command (which, on many Unix  sys‐
       tems, directs it to a printer), use the option

            -sOutputFile=%pipe%lpr

       Note  that the '%' characters need to be doubled on MS Windows to avoid
       mangling by the command interpreter.

       You can also send output to standard output:

            -sOutputFile=-
       or
            -sOutputFile=%stdout%

       In this case you must also use the -q switch,  to  prevent  Ghostscript
       from writing messages to standard output.

       To select a specific paper size, use the command line switch

            -sPAPERSIZE=<paper_size>

       for instance

            -sPAPERSIZE=a4
       or
            -sPAPERSIZE=legal

       Most ISO and US paper sizes are recognized. See the usage documentation
       for a  full  list,  or  the  definitions  in  the  initialization  file
       "gs_statd.ps".

       Ghostscript  can do many things other than print or view PostScript and
       PDF files.  For example, if you want to know  the  bounding  box  of  a
       PostScript  (or EPS) file, Ghostscript provides a special "device" that
       just prints out this information.

       For example, using one of the example  files  distributed  with  Ghost‐
       script,

            gs -sDEVICE=bbox golfer.ps

       prints out

            %%BoundingBox: 0 25 583 732
            %%HiResBoundingBox: 0.808497 25.009496 582.994503 731.809445

       including non-interactive utilities like "sed". Also, .desktop files
       contain a proper name, information about whether the application runs
       in a terminal and whether it supports startup notifications.

       The .desktop files are searched in $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications (by
       default $HOME/.local/share/applications) and in the "applications"
       subdirectory of each entry of $XDG_DATA_DIRS (by default
       /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/).

       Files with the same name in $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications take precedence
       over files in $XDG_DATA_DIRS, so that you can overwrite parts of the
       system-wide .desktop files by copying them to your local directory and
       making changes.

       i3-dmenu-desktop displays the "Name" value in the localized version
       depending on LC_MESSAGES as specified in the Desktop Entry
       Specification.

       You can pass a filename or URL (%f/%F and %u/%U field codes in the
       .desktop file respectively) by appending it to the name of the
       application. E.g., if you want to launch "GNU Emacs 24" with the patch
       /tmp/foobar.txt, you would type "emacs", press TAB, type "
       /tmp/foobar.txt" and press ENTER.

       .desktop files with Terminal=true are started using
       i3-sensible-terminal(1).

       .desktop files with NoDisplay=true or Hidden=true are skipped.

       UTF-8 is supported, of course, but dmenu does not support displaying
       all glyphs. E.g., xfce4-terminal.desktop's Name[fi]=Pääte will be
       displayed just fine, but not its Name[ru]=Терминал.

plog
pon
       pon,  invoked without arguments, runs the /etc/ppp/ppp_on_boot file, if
       it exists and is  executable.  Otherwise,  a  PPP  connection  will  be
       started  using configuration from /etc/ppp/peers/provider.  This is the
       default behaviour unless an isp-name argument is given.

       For instance, to use ISP configuration "myisp" run:

              pon myisp

       pon will then use the options file /etc/ppp/peers/myisp.  You can  pass
       additional  pppd  options  after the ISP name, too.  pon can be used to
       run multiple, simultaneous PPP connections.

       pon takes the following command line options:

              -q --quick
                     disconnect when ip-up finishes running.  This function is
                     only available to the root user.

   poff
       poff  closes  a PPP connection. If more than one PPP connection exists,
       the one named in the argument to poff will be killed, e.g.

              poff myprovider2

       will terminate the connection to myprovider2, and leave the PPP connec‐
       tions to e.g. "myprovider1" or "myprovider3" up and running.

       poff takes the following command line options:

              -r     causes the connection to be redialed after it is dropped.

              -d     toggles the state of pppd's debug option.

              -c     causes pppd(8) to renegotiate compression.

              -a     stops  all  running  ppp  connections.  If  the  argument
                     isp-name is given it will be ignored.

              -h     displays help information.

              -v     prints the version and exits.

              If no argument is given, poff will stop or signal  pppd  if  and
              only  if  there is exactly one running. If more than one connec‐
              tion is active, it will exit with an error code of 1.

   plog
       plog shows you the last few lines of  /var/log/ppp.log.  If  that  file
       doesn't  exist, it shows you the last few lines of your /var/log/syslog
       file, but excluding the lines not generated by pppd.  This script makes
       use  of the tail(1) command, so arguments that can be passed to tail(1)
       can also be passed to plog.

       Note: the plog script can only be used by root or another system admin‐
       istrator  in  group  "adm",  due to security reasons. Also, to have all
       pppd-generated information in one logfile, that plog can show, you need
       the following line in your /etc/syslog.conf file:

       local2.*       -/var/log/ppp.log

This  program  is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only

       keys used to make the signature are valid. There are  no  configuration
       files and only a few options are implemented.

       gpgv  assumes  that all keys in the keyring are trustworthy.  That does
       also mean that it does not check for expired or revoked keys.

       By default a keyring named ‘trustedkeys.gpg’  is  used.   This  default
       keyring  is  assumed  to  be in the home directory of GnuPG, either the
       default home directory or the one set by an option  or  an  environment
       variable.   The  option  --keyring  may  be used to specify a different

perlbug
In most cases, you can just run it interactively from a command line
       without any special arguments and follow the prompts.

       If you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one that was not part
       of the standard distribution), a binary distribution, or a non-core
       module (such as Tk, DBI, etc), then please see the documentation that
       came with that distribution to determine the correct place to report
       bugs.

       If you are unable to send your report using perlbug (most likely
       because your system doesn't have a way to send mail that perlbug
       recognizes), you may be able to use this tool to compose your report
       and save it to a file which you can then send to perlbug@perl.org using
       your regular mail client.

       In extreme cases, perlbug may not work well enough on your system to
       guide you through composing a bug report. In those cases, you may be
       able to use perlbug -d to get system configuration information to
       include in a manually composed bug report to perlbug@perl.org.

       When reporting a bug, please run through this checklist:

       What version of Perl you are running?
           Type "perl -v" at the command line to find out.

       Are you running the latest released version of perl?
           Look at http://www.perl.org/ to find out.  If you are not using the
           latest released version, please try to replicate your bug on the
           latest stable release.

           Note that reports about bugs in old versions of Perl, especially
           those which indicate you haven't also tested the current stable
           release of Perl, are likely to receive less attention from the
           volunteers who build and maintain Perl than reports about bugs in
           the current release.

           This tool isn't appropriate for reporting bugs in any version prior
           to Perl 5.0.

       Are you sure what you have is a bug?
           A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to be
           documented features in Perl.  Make sure the issue you've run into
           isn't intentional by glancing through the documentation that comes
           with the Perl distribution.

           Given the sheer volume of Perl documentation, this isn't a trivial
           undertaking, but if you can point to documentation that suggests
           the behaviour you're seeing is wrong, your issue is likely to
           receive more attention. You may want to start with perldoc perltrap
           for pointers to common traps that new (and experienced) Perl
           programmers run into.

           If you're unsure of the meaning of an error message you've run
           across, perldoc perldiag for an explanation.  If the message isn't
           in perldiag, it probably isn't generated by Perl.  You may have
           luck consulting your operating system documentation instead.

           If you are on a non-UNIX platform perldoc perlport, as some
           features may be unimplemented or work differently.

           You may be able to figure out what's going wrong using the Perl
           debugger.  For information about how to use the debugger perldoc
           perldebug.

       Do you have a proper test case?
           The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be
           fixed -- if nobody can duplicate your problem, it probably won't be
           addressed.

           A good test case has most of these attributes: short, simple code;
           few dependencies on external commands, modules, or libraries; no
           platform-dependent code (unless it's a platform-specific bug);
           clear, simple documentation.

           A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be included
           in Perl's test suite.  If you have the time, consider writing your
           test case so that it can be easily included into the standard test
           suite.

       Have you included all relevant information?
           Be sure to include the exact error messages, if any.  "Perl gave an
           error" is not an exact error message.

           If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a debugger
           (dbx, gdb, etc) to produce a stack trace to include in the bug
           report.

           NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info (often
           -g), the stack trace is likely to be somewhat hard to use because
           it will most probably contain only the function names and not their
           arguments.  If possible, recompile your Perl with debug info and
           reproduce the crash and the stack trace.

       Can you describe the bug in plain English?
           The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely
           it will be fixed.  Any insight you can provide into the problem
           will help a great deal.  In other words, try to analyze the problem
           (to the extent you can) and report your discoveries.

       Can you fix the bug yourself?
           A bug report which includes a patch to fix it will almost
           definitely be fixed.  When sending a patch, please use the "diff"
           program with the "-u" option to generate "unified" diff files.  Bug
           reports with patches are likely to receive significantly more
           attention and interest than those without patches.

           Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or requests
           for more detailed explanations about your fix.

           Here are a few hints for creating high-quality patches:

           Make sure the patch is not reversed (the first argument to diff is
           typically the original file, the second argument your changed
           file).  Make sure you test your patch by applying it with the
           "patch" program before you send it on its way.  Try to follow the
           same style as the code you are trying to patch.  Make sure your
           patch really does work ("make test", if the thing you're patching
           is covered by Perl's test suite).

       Can you use "perlbug" to submit the report?
           perlbug will, amongst other things, ensure your report includes
           crucial information about your version of perl.  If "perlbug" is
           unable to mail your report after you have typed it in, you may have
           to compose the message yourself, add the output produced by
           "perlbug -d" and email it to perlbug@perl.org.  If, for some
           reason, you cannot run "perlbug" at all on your system, be sure to
           include the entire output produced by running "perl -V" (note the
           uppercase V).

           Whether you use "perlbug" or send the email manually, please make
           your Subject line informative.  "a bug" is not informative.
           Neither is "perl crashes" nor is "HELP!!!".  These don't help.

ntpq
It uses the standard NTP mode 6 control mes‐
       sage  formats defined in Appendix B of the NTPv3 specification RFC1305.
       The same formats are used in NTPv4, although some of the variables have
       changed  and  new  ones  added. The description on this page is for the
       NTPv4 variables.

       The program can be run either in interactive mode or  controlled  using
       command  line arguments. Requests to read and write arbitrary variables
       can be assembled, with raw  and  pretty-printed  output  options  being
       available. The ntpq can also obtain and print a list of peers in a com‐
       mon format by sending multiple queries to the server.

       If one or more request options is included on  the  command  line  when
       ntpq  is executed, each of the requests will be sent to the NTP servers
       running on each of the hosts given as command  line  arguments,  or  on
       localhost  by  default.  If  no  request  options  are given, ntpq will
       attempt to read commands from the standard input and execute  these  on
       the  NTP  server  running  on the first host given on the command line,
       again defaulting to localhost when no other  host  is  specified.  ntpq
       will prompt for commands if the standard input is a terminal device.

       ntpq  uses  NTP  mode 6 packets to communicate with the NTP server, and
       hence can be used to query any compatible server on the  network  which
       permits  it.  Note  that since NTP is a UDP protocol this communication
       will be somewhat unreliable, especially over large distances  in  terms
       of network topology. ntpq makes one attempt to retransmit requests, and
       will time requests out if the remote host is not heard  from  within  a
       suitable timeout time.

       Note  that  in  contexts  where a host name is expected, a -4 qualifier
       preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to  the  IPv4  namespace,
       while a -6 qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace.

pon
       pon,  invoked without arguments, runs the /etc/ppp/ppp_on_boot file, if
       it exists and is  executable.  Otherwise,  a  PPP  connection  will  be
       started  using configuration from /etc/ppp/peers/provider.  This is the

              tion is active, it will exit with an error code of 1.

   plog
       plog shows you the last few lines of  /var/log/ppp.log.  If  that  file
       doesn't  exist, it shows you the last few lines of your /var/log/syslog
       file, but excluding the lines not generated by pppd.  This script makes
       use  of the tail(1) command, so arguments that can be passed to tail(1)
       can also be passed to plog.

       Note: the plog script can only be used by root or another system admin‐
       istrator  in  group  "adm",  due to security reasons. Also, to have all

       named LINUX on the boot floppy.  This default can be changed,  see  the
       section on the syslinux configuration file.

       If  the  Shift  or  Alt  keys are held down during boot, or the Caps or
       Scroll locks are set, syslinux will display a  lilo(8)  -style  "boot:"
       prompt.  The user can then type a kernel file name followed by any ker‐
       nel parameters. The SYSLINUX bootloader does not need to know about the
       kernel  file  in  advance;  all  that  is required is that it is a file
       located in the root directory on the disk.

       Syslinux supports the loading of  initial  ramdisks  (initrd)  and  the
       bzImage kernel format.

When run without arguments, it adds the files

     corresponding certificate information from the filename obtained by
     appending -cert.pub to the name of the private key file.  Alternative
     file names can be given on the command line.

     If any file requires a passphrase, ssh-add asks for the passphrase from
     the user.  The passphrase is read from the user's tty.  ssh-add retries
     the last passphrase if multiple identity files are given.

     The authentication agent must be running and the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environ‐
     ment variable must contain the name of its socket for ssh-add to work.

     The options are as follows:

     -c      Indicates that added identities should be subject to confirmation
             before being used for authentication.  Confirmation is performed
             by the SSH_ASKPASS program mentioned below.  Successful confirma‐
             tion is signaled by a zero exit status from the SSH_ASKPASS pro‐
             gram, rather than text entered into the requester.

     -D      Deletes all identities from the agent.

     -d      Instead of adding identities, removes identities from the agent.
             If ssh-add has been run without arguments, the keys for the
             default identities and their corresponding certificates will be
             removed.  Otherwise, the argument list will be interpreted as a
             list of paths to public key files to specify keys and certifi‐
             cates to be removed from the agent.  If no public key is found at
             a given path, ssh-add will append .pub and retry.

             Remove keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library pkcs11.

     -k      When loading keys into or deleting keys from the agent, process

If a directory has a default  ACL,  get‐

       If getfacl is used on a file system that does not support ACLs, getfacl
       displays  the  access  permissions defined by the traditional file mode
       permission bits.

       The output format of getfacl is as follows:
               1:  # file: somedir/
               2:  # owner: lisa

              13:  default:group::r-x
              14:  default:mask::r-x
              15:  default:other::---


       Lines 1--3 indicate the file name, owner, and owning group.

       Line 4 indicates the setuid (s),  setgid  (s),  and  sticky  (t)  bits:
       either  the  letter representing the bit, or else a dash (-). This line
       is included if any of those bits is set and left out otherwise,  so  it
       will  not  be  shown  for most files. (See CONFORMANCE TO POSIX 1003.1e
       DRAFT STANDARD 17 below.)

       Lines 5, 7 and 10 correspond to the user, group and other fields of the
       file mode permission bits. These three are called the base ACL entries.
       Lines 6 and 8 are named user and named group entries.  Line  9  is  the
       effective  rights  mask. This entry limits the effective rights granted
       to all groups and to named users. (The file owner  and  others  permis‐
       sions  are not affected by the effective rights mask; all other entries
       are.)  Lines 11--15 display the default ACL associated with this direc‐
       tory.  Directories  may  have a default ACL. Regular files never have a
       default ACL.

       The default behavior for getfacl is to display both  the  ACL  and  the
       default ACL, and to include an effective rights comment for lines where
       the rights of the entry differ from the effective rights.

       If output is to a terminal, the effective rights comment is aligned  to
       column  40.  Otherwise,  a single tab character separates the ACL entry
       and the effective rights comment.

       The ACL listings of multiple files are separated by blank  lines.   The
       output of getfacl can also be used as input to setfacl.

       which contains a few features not described in the AWK book,  and  mawk

rlogin
It is intended to replace rlogin
     and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between two
     untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary
     TCP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     ssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user
     name).  The user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using
     one of several methods depending on the protocol version used (see
     below).

     If command is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a
     login shell.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      Forces ssh to try protocol version 1 only.

     -2      Forces ssh to try protocol version 2 only.

     -4      Forces ssh to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces ssh to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A      Enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.  This
             can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration
             file.

             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the
             ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the
             agent's UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent through
             the forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material
             from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys
             that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into
             the agent.

     -a      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

     -b bind_address
             Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of
             the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than one
             address.

     -C      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout,
             stderr, and data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections).  The
             compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1), and the
             “level” can be controlled by the CompressionLevel option for pro‐
             tocol version 1.  Compression is desirable on modem lines and
             other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast
             networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis
             in the configuration files; see the Compression option.

     -c cipher_spec
             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

             Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher.  The
             supported values are “3des”, “blowfish”, and “des”.  3des
             (triple-des) is an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt triple with three dif‐
             ferent keys.  It is believed to be secure.  blowfish is a fast
             block cipher; it appears very secure and is much faster than
             3des.  des is only supported in the ssh client for interoperabil‐
             ity with legacy protocol 1 implementations that do not support
             the 3des cipher.  Its use is strongly discouraged due to crypto‐
             graphic weaknesses.  The default is “3des”.

             For protocol version 2, cipher_spec is a comma-separated list of
             ciphers listed in order of preference.  See the Ciphers keyword
             in ssh_config(5) for more information.

     -D [bind_address:]port
             Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.
             This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local
             side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a
             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to
             determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently
             the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act
             as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.
             Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the configura‐
             tion file.

             IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in
             square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged
             ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with
             the GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may
             be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The
             bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be
             bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates
             that the port should be available from all interfaces.

     -E log_file
             Append debug logs to log_file instead of standard error.

     -e escape_char
             Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).
             The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a
             line.  The escape character followed by a dot (‘.’) closes the
             connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and
             followed by itself sends the escape character once.  Setting the
             character to “none” disables any escapes and makes the session
             fully transparent.

     -F configfile
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a con‐
             figuration file is given on the command line, the system-wide
             configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config) will be ignored.  The
             default for the per-user configuration file is ~/.ssh/config.

     -f      Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.
             This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or
             passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This
             implies -n.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a
             remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm.

             If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to “yes”,
             then a client started with -f will wait for all remote port for‐
             wards to be successfully established before placing itself in the
             background.

     -g      Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.

     -I pkcs11
             Specify the PKCS#11 shared library ssh should use to communicate
             with a PKCS#11 token providing the user's private RSA key.

     -i identity_file
             Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public
             key authentication is read.  The default is ~/.ssh/identity for
             protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa,
             ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa for protocol version 2.
             Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in the
             configuration file.  It is possible to have multiple -i options
             (and multiple identities specified in configuration files).  ssh
             will also try to load certificate information from the filename
             obtained by appending -cert.pub to identity filenames.

     -K      Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation)
             of GSSAPI credentials to the server.

     -k      Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the
             server.

     -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
             Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be
             forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side.  This
             works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side,
             optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a con‐
             nection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port
             hostport from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be
             specified in the configuration file.  IPv6 addresses can be spec‐
             ified by enclosing the address in square brackets.  Only the
             superuser can forward privileged ports.  By default, the local
             port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts setting.  How‐
             ever, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection
             to a specific address.  The bind_address of “localhost” indicates
             that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an
             empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be available
             from all interfaces.

     -l login_name
             Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.  This also
             may be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.

     -M      Places the ssh client into “master” mode for connection sharing.
             Multiple -M options places ssh into “master” mode with confirma‐
             tion required before slave connections are accepted.  Refer to
             the description of ControlMaster in ssh_config(5) for details.

     -m mac_spec
             Additionally, for protocol version 2 a comma-separated list of
             MAC (message authentication code) algorithms can be specified in
             order of preference.  See the MACs keyword for more information.

     -N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just for‐
             warding ports (protocol version 2 only).

     -n      Redirects stdin from /dev/null (actually, prevents reading from
             stdin).  This must be used when ssh is run in the background.

       A  remote object registry is a bootstrap naming service that is used by
       RMI servers on the same host to bind remote objects to  names.  Clients
       on  local  and  remote  hosts  can then look up remote objects and make
       remote method invocations.

       The registry is typically used to locate the  first  remote  object  on
       which  an application needs to invoke methods. That object in turn will
       provide application-specific support for finding other objects.

       The methods of the java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry class are  used  to
       get a registry operating on the local host or local host and port.

       The  URL-based  methods  of the java.rmi.Naming class operate on a reg‐
       istry and can be used to look up a remote object on any  host,  and  on
       the  local host: bind a simple (string) name to a remote object, rebind
       a new name to a remote object (overriding the old  binding),  unbind  a
       remote object, and list the URLs bound in the registry.

netkit-ftp
The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote
     network site.

     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command inter‐
     preter.

     -4    Use only IPv4 to contact any host.

     -6    Use IPv6 only.

     -p    Use passive mode for data transfers. Allows use of ftp in environ‐
           ments where a firewall prevents connections from the outside world
           back to the client machine. Requires that the ftp server support
           the PASV command. This is the default if invoked as pftp.

     -i    Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     -n    Restrains ftp from attempting “auto-login” upon initial connection.
           If auto-login is enabled, ftp will check the .netrc (see netrc(5))
           file in the user's home directory for an entry describing an
           account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists, ftp will prompt
           for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on
           the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an
           account with which to login.

     -e    Disables command editing and history support, if it was compiled
           into the ftp executable. Otherwise, does nothing.

     -g    Disables file name globbing.

     -v    Verbose option forces ftp to show all responses from the remote
           server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     -d    Enables debugging.

     The client host and an optional port number with which ftp is to communi‐
     cate may be specified on the command line.  If this is done, ftp will
     immediately attempt to establish a connection to an FTP server on that
     host; otherwise, ftp will enter its command interpreter and await
     instructions from the user.  When ftp is awaiting commands from the user
     the prompt ‘ftp>’ is provided to the user.  The following commands are
     recognized by ftp:

     ! [command [args]]
                 Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there
                 are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
                 directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

     $ macro-name [args]
                 Execute the macro macro-name that was defined with the macdef
                 command.  Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.

     account [passwd]
                 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
                 for access to resources once a login has been successfully
                 completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
                 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     append local-file [remote-file]
                 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
                 remote-file is left unspecified, the local file name is used
                 in naming the remote file after being altered by any ntrans
                 or nmap setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 type, format, mode, and structure.

     ascii       Set the file transfer type to network ASCII.  This is the
                 default type.

     bell        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer com‐
                 mand is completed.

     binary      Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer.

     bye         Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit
                 ftp.  An end of file will also terminate the session and
                 exit.

     case        Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during mget
                 commands.  When case is on (default is off), remote computer
                 file names with all letters in upper case are written in the
                 local directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

     cd remote-directory
                 Change the working directory on the remote machine to
                 remote-directory.

     cdup        Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of
                 the current remote machine working directory.

     chmod mode file-name
                 Change the permission modes of the file file-name on the
                 remote sytem to mode.

     close       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return
                 to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros are erased.

     cr          Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file
                 retrieval.  Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed
                 sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When cr is on (the
                 default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence to
                 conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.
                 Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain single line‐
                 feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds
                 may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when cr is
                 off.

     qc          Toggle the printing of control characters in the output of
                 ASCII type commands.  When this is turned on, control charac‐
                 ters are replaced with a question mark if the output file is
                 the standard output.  This is the default when the standard
                 output is a tty.

     delete remote-file
                 Delete the file remote-file on the remote machine.

     debug [debug-value]
                 Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional debug-value is speci‐
                 fied it is used to set the debugging level.  When debugging
                 is on, ftp prints each command sent to the remote machine,
                 preceded by the string ‘-->’

     dir [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a listing of the directory contents in the directory,
                 remote-directory, and, optionally, placing the output in
                 local-file.  If interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt
                 the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the tar‐
                 get local file for receiving dir output.  If no directory is
                 specified, the current working directory on the remote
                 machine is used.  If no local file is specified, or
                 local-file is -, output comes to the terminal.

     disconnect  A synonym for close.

     form format
                 Set the file transfer form to format.  The default format is
                 “file”.

     get remote-file [local-file]
                 Retrieve the remote-file and store it on the local machine.
                 If the local file name is not specified, it is given the same
                 name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
                 the current case, ntrans, and nmap settings.  The current
                 settings for type, form, mode, and structure are used while
                 transferring the file.

     glob        Toggle filename expansion for mdelete, mget and mput.  If
                 globbing is turned off with glob, the file name arguments are
                 taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for mput is done
                 as in csh(1).  For mdelete and mget, each remote file name is
                 expanded separately on the remote machine and the lists are
                 not merged.  Expansion of a directory name is likely to be
                 different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the
                 exact result depends on the foreign operating system and ftp
                 server, and can be previewed by doing ‘mls remote-files -’
                 Note: mget and mput are not meant to transfer entire direc‐
                 tory subtrees of files.  That can be done by transferring a
                 tar(1) archive of the subtree (in binary mode).

     hash        Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block trans‐
                 ferred.  The size of a data block is 1024 bytes.

     help [command]
                 Print an informative message about the meaning of command.
                 If no argument is given, ftp prints a list of the known com‐
                 mands.

     idle [seconds]
                 Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to seconds sec‐
                 onds.  If seconds is omitted, the current inactivity timer is
                 printed.

     ipany       Allow the address resolver to return any address family.

     ipv4        Restrict the address resolver to look only for IPv4
                 addresses.

     ipv6        Restrict host adressing to IPv6 only.

     lcd [directory]
                 Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no
                 directory is specified, the user's home directory is used.

     ls [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
                 machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa‐
                 tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
                 UNIX systems will produce output from the command ‘ls -l’.
                 (See also nlist.)  If remote-directory is left unspecified,
                 the current working directory is used.  If interactive
                 prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the
                 last argument is indeed the target local file for receiving
                 ls output.  If no local file is specified, or if local-file
                 is ‘-’, the output is sent to the terminal.

     macdef macro-name
                 Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
                 macro-name; a null line (consecutive newline characters in a
                 file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macro
                 input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total
                 characters in all defined macros.  Macros remain defined
                 until a close command is executed.  The macro processor
                 interprets `$' and `\' as special characters.  A `$' followed
                 by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding
                 argument on the macro invocation command line.  A `$' fol‐
                 lowed by an `i' signals that macro processor that the execut‐
                 ing macro is to be looped.  On the first pass `$i' is
                 replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation com‐
                 mand line, on the second pass it is replaced by the second
                 argument, and so on.  A `\' followed by any character is
                 replaced by that character.  Use the `\' to prevent special
                 treatment of the `$'.

     mdelete [remote-files]
                 Delete the remote-files on the remote machine.

     mdir remote-files local-file
                 Like dir, except multiple remote files may be specified.  If
                 interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to ver‐
                 ify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
                 for receiving mdir output.

     mget remote-files
                 Expand the remote-files on the remote machine and do a get
                 for each file name thus produced.  See glob for details on
                 the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be
                 processed according to case, ntrans, and nmap settings.
                 Files are transferred into the local working directory, which
                 can be changed with ‘lcd directory’; new local directories
                 can be created with ‘! mkdir directory’.

     mkdir directory-name
                 Make a directory on the remote machine.

     mls remote-files local-file
                 Like nlist, except multiple remote files may be specified,
                 and the local-file must be specified.  If interactive prompt‐
                 ing is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last
                 argument is indeed the target local file for receiving mls
                 output.

     mode [mode-name]
                 Set the file transfer mode to mode-name.  The default mode is
                 “stream” mode.

     modtime file-name
                 Show the last modification time of the file on the remote
                 machine.

     mput local-files
                 Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as argu‐
                 ments and do a put for each file in the resulting list.  See
                 glob for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file names
                 will then be processed according to ntrans and nmap settings.

     newer file-name [local-file]
                 Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file
                 is more recent that the file on the current system.  If the
                 file does not exist on the current system, the remote file is
                 considered newer.  Otherwise, this command is identical to
                 get.

     nlist [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a  list of the files in a directory on the remote
                 machine.  If remote-directory is left unspecified, the cur‐
                 rent working directory is used.  If interactive prompting is
                 on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last argument
                 is indeed the target local file for receiving nlist output.
                 If no local file is specified, or if local-file is -, the
                 output is sent to the terminal.

     nmap [inpattern outpattern]
                 Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments
                 are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset.  If
                 arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
                 mput commands and put commands issued without a specified
                 remote target filename.  If arguments are specified, local
                 filenames are mapped during mget commands and get commands
                 issued without a specified local target filename.  This com‐
                 mand is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer
                 with different file naming conventions or practices.  The
                 mapping follows the pattern set by inpattern and outpattern.
                 [Inpattern] is a template for incoming filenames (which may
                 have already been processed according to the ntrans and case
                 settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by including
                 the sequences `$1', `$2', ..., `$9' in inpattern.  Use `\' to
                 prevent this special treatment of the `$' character.  All
                 other characters are treated literally, and are used to
                 determine the nmap [inpattern] variable values.  For example,
                 given inpattern $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data",
                 $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2 would have the value
                 "data".  The outpattern determines the resulting mapped file‐
                 name.  The sequences `$1', `$2', ...., `$9' are replaced by
                 any value resulting from the inpattern template.  The
                 sequence `$0' is replace by the original filename.  Addition‐
                 ally, the sequence ‘[seq1, seq2]’ is replaced by [seq1] if
                 seq1 is not a null string; otherwise it is replaced by seq2.
                 For example, the command

                       nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

                 would yield the output filename "myfile.data" for input file‐
                 names "myfile.data" and "myfile.data.old", "myfile.file" for
                 the input filename "myfile", and "myfile.myfile" for the
                 input filename ".myfile".  Spaces may be included in
                 outpattern, as in the example: `nmap $1 sed "s/  *$//" > $1'
                 .  Use the `\' character to prevent special treatment of the
                 `$','[','[', and `,' characters.

     ntrans [inchars [outchars]]
                 Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
                 If no arguments are specified, the filename character trans‐
                 lation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, char‐
                 acters in remote filenames are translated during mput com‐
                 mands and put commands issued without a specified remote tar‐
                 get filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in
                 local filenames are translated during mget commands and get
                 commands issued without a specified local target filename.
                 This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
                 computer with different file naming conventions or practices.
                 Characters in a filename matching a character in inchars are
                 replaced with the corresponding character in outchars.  If
                 the character's position in inchars is longer than the length
                 of outchars, the character is deleted from the file name.

     open host [port]
                 Establish a connection to the specified host FTP server.  An
                 optional port number may be supplied, in which case, ftp will
                 attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the
                 auto-login option is on (default), ftp will also attempt to
                 automatically log the user in to the FTP server (see below).

     prompt      Toggle interactive prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs
                 during multiple file transfers to allow the user to selec‐
                 tively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off
                 (default is on), any mget or mput will transfer all files,
                 and any mdelete will delete all files.

     proxy ftp-command
                 Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.
                 This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote ftp
                 servers for transferring files between the two servers.  The
                 first proxy command should be an open, to establish the sec‐
                 ondary control connection.  Enter the command "proxy ?" to
                 see other ftp commands executable on the secondary connec‐
                 tion.  The following commands behave differently when pref‐
                 aced by proxy: open will not define new macros during the
                 auto-login process, close will not erase existing macro defi‐
                 nitions, get and mget transfer files from the host on the
                 primary control connection to the host on the secondary con‐
                 trol connection, and put, mput, and append transfer files
                 from the host on the secondary control connection to the host
                 on the primary control connection.  Third party file trans‐
                 fers depend upon support of the ftp protocol PASV command by
                 the server on the secondary control connection.

     put local-file [remote-file]
                 Store a local file on the remote machine.  If remote-file is
                 left unspecified, the local file name is used after process‐
                 ing according to any ntrans or nmap settings in naming the
                 remote file.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 type, format, mode, and structure.

By using OMAPI and omshell, you do

       can  make the changes while the server is running.   Omshell provides a
       way of accessing OMAPI.

       OMAPI is simply a communications mechanism that allows you  to  manipu‐
       late  objects.    In order to actually use omshell, you must understand
       what objects are available and how  to  use  them.   Documentation  for

rview
It can be used
       to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful  for  editing
       programs.

       There  are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi win‐
       dows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line  editing,  filename
       completion,   on-line   help,   visual  selection,  etc..   See  ":help
       vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

       While running Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the  on-line  help
       system, with the ":help" command.  See the ON-LINE HELP section below.

       Most often Vim is started to edit a single file with the command

            vim file

       More generally Vim is started with:

            vim [options] [filelist]

       If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
       Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used  to  choose
       one or more files to be edited.

       file ..     A  list  of  filenames.   The first one will be the current
                   file and read into the buffer.  The cursor  will  be  posi‐
                   tioned on the first line of the buffer.  You can get to the
                   other files with the ":next" command.  To edit a file  that
                   starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "--".

       -           The  file  to  edit  is read from stdin.  Commands are read
                   from stderr, which should be a tty.

       -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on
                   a  "tag",  a sort of goto label.  {tag} is looked up in the
                   tags file, the associated file becomes the current file and
                   the  associated  command  is executed.  Mostly this is used
                   for C programs, in which case {tag}  could  be  a  function
                   name.  The effect is that the file containing that function
                   becomes the current file and the cursor  is  positioned  on
                   the start of the function.  See ":help tag-commands".

       -q [errorfile]
                   Start  in  quickFix mode.  The file [errorfile] is read and
                   the first error is displayed.  If [errorfile]  is  omitted,
                   the  filename  is  obtained  from  the  'errorfile'  option
                   (defaults to "AztecC.Err" for the  Amiga,  "errors.err"  on
                   other  systems).   Further errors can be jumped to with the
                   ":cn" command.  See ":help quickfix".

       Vim behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the exe‐
       cutable may still be the same file).

       vim       The "normal" way, everything is default.

       ex        Start  in Ex mode.  Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.
                 Can also be done with the "-e" argument.

       view      Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from  writing
                 the files.  Can also be done with the "-R" argument.

       gvim gview
                 The GUI version.  Starts a new window.  Can also be done with
                 the "-g" argument.

       evim eview
                 The GUI version in easy mode.  Starts a new window.  Can also
                 be done with the "-y" argument.

       rvim rview rgvim rgview
                 Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possi‐
                 ble to start shell commands, or suspend  Vim.   Can  also  be
                 done with the "-Z" argument.

lesskey
The input file is a text file which describes the key bindings.  If the
       input  file is "-", standard input is read.  If no input file is speci‐
       fied, a standard filename is used as the name of the input file,  which
       depends  on  the  system being used: On Unix systems, $HOME/.lesskey is
       used; on MS-DOS systems, $HOME/_lesskey is used; and  on  OS/2  systems
       $HOME/lesskey.ini  is used, or $INIT/lesskey.ini if $HOME is undefined.
       The output file is a binary file which is used by less.  If  no  output
       file  is  specified,  and  the environment variable LESSKEY is set, the
       value of LESSKEY is used as the name of the output file.  Otherwise,  a
       standard filename is used as the name of the output file, which depends
       on the system being used: On Unix  and  OS-9  systems,  $HOME/.less  is
       used;  on  MS-DOS  systems,  $HOME/_less  is used; and on OS/2 systems,
       $HOME/less.ini is used, or $INIT/less.ini if $HOME  is  undefined.   If
       the output file already exists, lesskey will overwrite it.

       The  -V  or --version option causes lesskey to print its version number
       and immediately exit.  If -V or --version is present, other options and
       arguments are ignored.

       The  input  file consists of one or more sections.  Each section starts
       with a line that identifies the type  of  section.   Possible  sections
       are:

       #command
              Defines new command keys.

       #line-edit
              Defines new line-editing keys.

script
It is
     useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session
     as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out
     later with lpr(1).

     If the argument file is given, script saves all dialogue in file.  If no
     file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file typescript.

     Options:

     -a, --append
             Append the output to file or typescript, retaining the prior con‐
             tents.

     -c, --command command
             Run the command rather than an interactive shell.  This makes it
             easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves
             differently when its stdout is not a tty.

     -e, --return
             Return the exit code of the child process.  Uses the same format
             as bash termination on signal termination exit code is 128+n.

     -f, --flush
             Flush output after each write.  This is nice for telecooperation:
             one person does `mkfifo foo; script -f foo', and another can
             supervise real-time what is being done using `cat foo'.

     --force
             Allow the default output destination, i.e. the typescript file,
             to be a hard or symbolic link.  The command will follow a sym‐
             bolic link.

     -q, --quiet
             Be quiet.

     -t, --timing[=file]
             Output timing data to standard error, or to file when given.
             This data contains two fields, separated by a space.  The first
             field indicates how much time elapsed since the previous output.
             The second field indicates how many characters were output this
             time.  This information can be used to replay typescripts with
             realistic typing and output delays.

     -V, --version
             Output version information and exit.

     -h, --help
             Output help and exit.

     The script ends when the forked shell exits (a control-D to exit the
     Bourne shell (sh(1)), and exit, logout or control-d (if ignoreeof is not
     set) for the C-shell, csh(1)).

     Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create garbage in the type‐
     script file.  Script works best with commands that do not manipulate the
     screen, the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal.

       junction  with  xdm,  the  -x  option  counts  the  number  of lines in
       /etc/ttys and then adds to that the number of the line in the  Xservers
       file  which  specifies the display.  The display name must be specified
       as the "line-name" using the -l option.  This sum is used as the "slot-
       number"  in  the  utmp file that this entry will be written at.  In the
       more general case, the -s option specifies  the  slot-number  directly.
       If for some strange reason your system uses a file other than /etc/ttys
       to manage init, the -t option can direct sessreg to look elsewhere  for
       a count of terminal sessions.

       Conversely,  System  V managers will not ever need to use these options
       (-x, -s and -t).  To make the program easier to document  and  explain,
       sessreg  accepts the BSD-specific flags in the System V environment and
       ignores them.

       BSD and Linux also have a  host-name  field  in  the  utmp  file  which
       doesn't exist in System V.  This option is also ignored by the System

tic
The  compiled  format  is  necessary  for use with the
       library routines in ncurses(3NCURSES).

       As described in term(5), the database may be either  a  directory  tree
       (one  file  per  terminal  entry)  or a hashed database (one record per
       entry).  The tic command writes only one type of  entry,  depending  on
       how it was built:

       ·   For directory trees, the top-level directory, e.g., /usr/share/ter‐
           minfo, specifies the location of the database.

       ·   For hashed databases, a filename is needed.  If the given  file  is
           not  found  by  that  name,  but  can be found by adding the suffix
           ".db", then that is used.

           The default name for the hashed database is the same as the default
           directory name (only adding a ".db" suffix).

       In either case (directory or hashed database), tic will create the con‐
       tainer if it does not exist.  For a directory, this would be the  "ter‐
       minfo" leaf, versus a "terminfo.db" file.

       The  results  are  normally  placed  in  the  system  terminfo database
       /etc/terminfo.  The compiled terminal description can be  placed  in  a
       different terminfo database.  There are two ways to achieve this:

       ·   First,  you  may override the system default either by using the -o
           option, or by setting the variable TERMINFO in your shell  environ‐
           ment to a valid database location.

       ·   Secondly,  if  tic  cannot  write  in /etc/terminfo or the location
           specified using your TERMINFO variable, it looks for the  directory
           $HOME/.terminfo  (or  hashed  database $HOME/.terminfo.db); if that
           location exists, the entry is placed there.

       Libraries that read terminfo entries are expected to check  in  succes‐
       sion

       ·   a location specified with the TERMINFO environment variable,

       ·   $HOME/.terminfo,

       ·   directories listed in the TERMINFO_DIRS environment variable,

       ·   a compiled-in list of directories (no default value), and

       ·   the system terminfo database (/etc/terminfo).

aconnect
The ports with the arbitrary subscription  per‐
       mission, such as created by aseqview(1), can be connected to any (MIDI)
       device ports using aconnect.  For example, to connect from port 64:0 to
       65:0, run as follows:

           % aconnect 64:0 65:0

       The connection is one-way, and the whole data to the sender port (64:0)
       is redirected to the receiver port (65:0).   When  another  port  (e.g.
       65:1)  is  attached  to  the same sender port, the data is sent to both
       receiver ports.  For disconnection, use -d option.

       % aconnect -d 64:0 65:0

       The address can be given using the client's name.

       % aconnect External:0 Emu8000:1

       Then the port 0 of the client matching with the  string  "External"  is
       connected to the port 1 of the client matching with the "Emu8000".

       Another  function of aconnect is to list the present ports on the given
       condition.  The input ports, which may  become  sender  ports,  can  be
       listed with -i option.

       % aconnect -i
       client 0: 'System' [type=kernel]
           0 'Timer           '
           1 'Announce        '
       client 64: 'External MIDI-0' [type=kernel]
           0 'MIDI 0-0        '

       Similarly, to see the output ports, use -o flag.

       You can remove all existing exported connections using -x option.  This
       function is useful for terminating the ALSA drivers, because  the  mod‐
       ules with sequencer connections cannot be unloaded unless their connec‐

       Otherwise,  if  the --no-archive option is used, outputpath is the name

   Notes about group passwords
       Group passwords are an inherent security problem since more than one
       person is permitted to know the password. However, groups are a useful
       tool for permitting co-operation between different users.

>>>BEGIN
sudo
sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/out‐
     put logging.  Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy
     and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end.  The
     default security policy is sudoers, which is configured via the file
     /etc/sudoers, or via LDAP.  See the Plugins section for more information.

     The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run
     sudo.  The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a
     password or another authentication mechanism.  If authentication is
     required, sudo will exit if the user's password is not entered within a
     configurable time limit.  This limit is policy-specific; the default
     password prompt timeout for the sudoers security policy is unlimited.

     Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user to run
     sudo again for a period of time without requiring authentication.  The
     sudoers policy caches credentials for 15 minutes, unless overridden in
     sudoers(5).  By running sudo with the -v option, a user can update the
     cached credentials without running a command.

     When invoked as sudoedit, the -e option (described below), is implied.

     Security policies may log successful and failed attempts to use sudo.  If
     an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input and output may
     be logged as well.

     The options are as follows:

     -A, --askpass
                 Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will read it from
                 the user's terminal.  If the -A (askpass) option is speci‐
                 fied, a (possibly graphical) helper program is executed to
                 read the user's password and output the password to the stan‐
                 dard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable is
                 set, it specifies the path to the helper program.  Otherwise,
                 if sudo.conf(5) contains a line specifying the askpass pro‐
                 gram, that value will be used.  For example:

                     # Path to askpass helper program
                     Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass

                 If no askpass program is available, sudo will exit with an
                 error.

     -b, --background
                 Run the given command in the background.  Note that it is not
                 possible to use shell job control to manipulate background
                 processes started by sudo.  Most interactive commands will
                 fail to work properly in background mode.

     -C num, --close-from=num
                 Close all file descriptors greater than or equal to num
                 before executing a command.  Values less than three are not
                 permitted.  By default, sudo will close all open file
                 descriptors other than standard input, standard output and
                 standard error when executing a command.  The security policy
                 may restrict the user's ability to use this option.  The
                 sudoers policy only permits use of the -C option when the
                 administrator has enabled the closefrom_override option.

     -E, --preserve-env
                 Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to pre‐
                 serve their existing environment variables.  The security
                 policy may return an error if the user does not have permis‐
                 sion to preserve the environment.

     -e, --edit  Edit one or more files instead of running a command.  In lieu
                 of a path name, the string "sudoedit" is used when consulting
                 the security policy.  If the user is authorized by the pol‐
                 icy, the following steps are taken:

                 1.   Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with
                      the owner set to the invoking user.

                 2.   The editor specified by the policy is run to edit the
                      temporary files.  The sudoers policy uses the
                      SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables (in
                      that order).  If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or

lzma
The native file format is the .xz
       format, but the legacy .lzma format used by LZMA  Utils  and  raw  com‐
       pressed streams with no container format headers are also supported.

       xz compresses or decompresses each file according to the selected oper‐
       ation mode.  If no files are given or file is -, xz reads from standard
       input and writes the processed data to standard output.  xz will refuse
       (display an error and skip the file) to write compressed data to  stan‐
       dard  output  if  it  is a terminal.  Similarly, xz will refuse to read
       compressed data from standard input if it is a terminal.

       Unless --stdout is specified, files other than - are written to  a  new
       file whose name is derived from the source file name:

       ·  When  compressing,  the  suffix  of  the  target file format (.xz or
          .lzma) is appended to the source filename to get  the  target  file‐
          name.

       ·  When  decompressing,  the  .xz  or  .lzma suffix is removed from the
          filename to get the target filename.  xz also  recognizes  the  suf‐
          fixes .txz and .tlz, and replaces them with the .tar suffix.

       If  the  target file already exists, an error is displayed and the file
       is skipped.

       Unless writing to standard output, xz will display a warning  and  skip
       the file if any of the following applies:

       ·  File  is  not  a regular file.  Symbolic links are not followed, and
          thus they are not considered to be regular files.

       ·  File has more than one hard link.

       ·  File has setuid, setgid, or sticky bit set.

       ·  The operation mode is set to compress and the  file  already  has  a
          suffix  of  the  target file format (.xz or .txz when compressing to
          the .xz format, and .lzma or .tlz when compressing to the .lzma for‐
          mat).

       ·  The  operation mode is set to decompress and the file doesn't have a
          suffix of any of the supported file formats (.xz,  .txz,  .lzma,  or
          .tlz).

       After successfully compressing or decompressing the file, xz copies the
       owner, group, permissions, access time, and modification time from  the
       source  file  to the target file.  If copying the group fails, the per‐
       missions are modified so that the target file doesn't become accessible
       to  users  who  didn't  have  permission to access the source file.  xz
       doesn't support copying other metadata like  access  control  lists  or
       extended attributes yet.

       Once  the  target file has been successfully closed, the source file is
       removed unless --keep was specified.  The source file is never  removed
       if the output is written to standard output.

       Sending  SIGINFO  or  SIGUSR1 to the xz process makes it print progress
       information to standard error.  This has only limited  use  since  when
       standard error is a terminal, using --verbose will display an automati‐
       cally updating progress indicator.

   Memory usage
       The memory usage of xz varies from a few hundred kilobytes  to  several
       gigabytes  depending  on  the  compression settings.  The settings used
       when compressing a file determine the memory requirements of the decom‐
       pressor.  Typically the decompressor needs 5 % to 20 % of the amount of
       memory that the compressor needed when creating the file.  For example,
       decompressing  a  file  created with xz -9 currently requires 65 MiB of
       memory.  Still, it is possible to have .xz files that  require  several
       gigabytes of memory to decompress.

       Especially  users  of  older  systems  may find the possibility of very
       large memory usage annoying.  To prevent  uncomfortable  surprises,  xz
       has  a  built-in  memory  usage  limiter, which is disabled by default.
       While some operating systems provide ways to limit the memory usage  of
       processes,  relying  on  it  wasn't  deemed to be flexible enough (e.g.
       using ulimit(1) to limit virtual memory tends to cripple mmap(2)).

       The memory usage limiter can be enabled with the  command  line  option
       --memlimit=limit.  Often it is more convenient to enable the limiter by
       default  by  setting  the  environment   variable   XZ_DEFAULTS,   e.g.
       XZ_DEFAULTS=--memlimit=150MiB.   It is possible to set the limits sepa‐
       rately for  compression  and  decompression  by  using  --memlimit-com‐
       press=limit  and  --memlimit-decompress=limit.  Using these two options
       outside XZ_DEFAULTS is rarely useful because a single run of xz  cannot
       do  both  compression  and  decompression  and  --memlimit=limit (or -

view
It can be used
       to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful  for  editing
       programs.

       There  are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi win‐
       dows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line  editing,  filename
       completion,   on-line   help,   visual  selection,  etc..   See  ":help
       vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

       While running Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the  on-line  help
       system, with the ":help" command.  See the ON-LINE HELP section below.

       Most often Vim is started to edit a single file with the command

            vim file

       More generally Vim is started with:

            vim [options] [filelist]

       If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
       Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used  to  choose
       one or more files to be edited.

       file ..     A  list  of  filenames.   The first one will be the current
                   file and read into the buffer.  The cursor  will  be  posi‐
                   tioned on the first line of the buffer.  You can get to the
                   other files with the ":next" command.  To edit a file  that
                   starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "--".

       -           The  file  to  edit  is read from stdin.  Commands are read
                   from stderr, which should be a tty.

       -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on
                   a  "tag",  a sort of goto label.  {tag} is looked up in the
                   tags file, the associated file becomes the current file and
                   the  associated  command  is executed.  Mostly this is used
                   for C programs, in which case {tag}  could  be  a  function
                   name.  The effect is that the file containing that function
                   becomes the current file and the cursor  is  positioned  on
                   the start of the function.  See ":help tag-commands".

       -q [errorfile]
                   Start  in  quickFix mode.  The file [errorfile] is read and
                   the first error is displayed.  If [errorfile]  is  omitted,
                   the  filename  is  obtained  from  the  'errorfile'  option
                   (defaults to "AztecC.Err" for the  Amiga,  "errors.err"  on
                   other  systems).   Further errors can be jumped to with the
                   ":cn" command.  See ":help quickfix".

       Vim behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the exe‐
       cutable may still be the same file).

       vim       The "normal" way, everything is default.

       ex        Start  in Ex mode.  Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.
                 Can also be done with the "-e" argument.

       view      Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from  writing
                 the files.  Can also be done with the "-R" argument.

                 ble to start shell commands, or suspend  Vim.   Can  also  be

debconf-apt-progress
The given command should be any command-line apt
       frontend; specifically, it must send progress information to the file
       descriptor selected by the "APT::Status-Fd" configuration option, and
       must keep the file descriptors nominated by the "APT::Keep-Fds"
       configuration option open when invoking debconf (directly or
       indirectly), as those file descriptors will be used for the debconf
       passthrough protocol.

       The arguments to the command you supply should generally include -y
       (for apt-get or aptitude) or similar to avoid the apt frontend
       prompting for input. debconf-apt-progress cannot do this itself because
       the appropriate argument may differ between apt frontends.

       The --start, --stop, --from, and --to options may be used to create a
       progress bar with multiple segments for different stages of
       installation, provided that the caller is a debconf confmodule. The
       caller may also interact with the progress bar itself using the debconf
       protocol if it so desires.

       debconf locks its config database when it starts up, which makes it
       unfortunately inconvenient to have one instance of debconf displaying
       the progress bar and another passing through questions from packages
       being installed. If you're using a multiple-segment progress bar,
       you'll need to eval the output of the --config option before starting
       the debconf frontend to work around this. See "EXAMPLES" in the
       EXAMPLES section below.

xsm
A session is a group of applications, each
       of which has a particular state.  xsm allows you  to  create  arbitrary
       sessions  -  for example, you might have a "light" session, a "develop‐
       ment" session, or an "xterminal" session.  Each session  can  have  its
       own  set  of applications.  Within a session, you can perform a "check‐
       point" to save application state, or a "shutdown"  to  save  state  and
       exit  the  session.  When you log back in to the system, you can load a
       specific session, and you can delete sessions you  no  longer  want  to
       keep.

       Some  session  managers  simply allow you to manually specify a list of
       applications to be started in a session.  xsm is more powerful  because
       it lets you run applications and have them automatically become part of
       the session.  On a simple level, xsm is useful  because  it  gives  you
       this ability to easily define which applications are in a session.  The
       true power of xsm, however, can be taken advantage  of  when  more  and
       more applications learn to save and restore their state.

ionice
If no arguments or just -p is given, ionice  will  query  the
       current I/O scheduling class and priority for that process.

       When  command  is  given,  ionice  will run this command with the given
       arguments.  If no class is specified, then  command  will  be  executed
       with the "best-effort" scheduling class.  The default priority level is
       4.

       As of this writing, a  process  can  be  in  one  of  three  scheduling
       classes:

       Idle   A program running with idle I/O priority will only get disk time
              when no other program has asked for disk I/O for a defined grace
              period.   The  impact  of  an  idle I/O process on normal system
              activity should be zero.  This scheduling class does not take  a
              priority  argument.  Presently, this scheduling class is permit‐
              ted for an ordinary user (since kernel 2.6.25).

       Best-effort
              This is the effective scheduling class for any process that  has
              not  asked for a specific I/O priority.  This class takes a pri‐
              ority argument from 0-7, with a lower number being higher prior‐
              ity.   Programs  running  at  the  same best-effort priority are
              served in a round-robin fashion.

              Note that before kernel 2.6.26 a process that has not asked  for
              an  I/O  priority  formally uses "none" as scheduling class, but
              the I/O scheduler will treat such processes as if it were in the
              best-effort  class.   The  priority within the best-effort class
              will be dynamically derived from  the  CPU  nice  level  of  the
              process: io_priority = (cpu_nice + 20) / 5.

              For  kernels  after 2.6.26 with the CFQ I/O scheduler, a process
              that has not asked for an I/O priority inherits its CPU schedul‐
              ing  class.  The I/O priority is derived from the CPU nice level
              of the process (same as before kernel 2.6.26).


       Realtime
              The RT scheduling class is  given  first  access  to  the  disk,
              regardless  of what else is going on in the system.  Thus the

ipcrm
In order  to  delete  such
       objects, you must be superuser, or the creator or owner of the object.

       System V IPC objects are of three types: shared memory, message queues,
       and semaphores.  Deletion of a message queue  or  semaphore  object  is
       immediate (regardless of whether any process still holds an IPC identi‐
       fier for the object).  A shared memory object is only removed after all
       currently  attached  processes have detached (shmdt(2)) the object from
       their virtual address space.

       Two syntax styles are supported.  The old Linux historical syntax spec‐
       ifies  a three letter keyword indicating which class of object is to be
       deleted, followed by one or more IPC identifiers for  objects  of  this
       type.

       The  SUS-compliant  syntax  allows  the  specification  of zero or more
       objects of all three types in a single command line, with objects spec‐
       ified either by key or by identifier. (See below.)  Both keys and iden‐
       tifiers may be specified in decimal,  hexadecimal  (specified  with  an
       initial '0x' or '0X'), or octal (specified with an initial '0').

startx
It is often run with no arguments.

       Arguments immediately following the startx command are used to start  a
       client in the same manner as xinit(1).  The special argument '--' marks
       the end of client arguments and the beginning of  server  options.   It
       may  be convenient to specify server options with startx to change on a
       per-session basis the default color depth, the server's notion  of  the
       number  of dots-per-inch the display device presents, or take advantage
       of a different server layout, as permitted by the  Xorg(1)  server  and
       specified in the xorg.conf(5) configuration.  Some examples of specify‐
       ing server arguments follow; consult the manual page for your X  server
       to determine which arguments are legal.

              startx -- -depth 16

              startx -- -dpi 100

              startx -- -layout Multihead

       To  determine  the  client to run, startx first looks for a file called
       .xinitrc in the user's home directory.  If that is not found,  it  uses
       the  file  xinitrc  in  the  xinit  library directory.  If command line
       client options are given, they override this behavior and revert to the
       xinit(1)  behavior.  To determine the server to run, startx first looks
       for a file called .xserverrc in the user's home directory.  If that  is
       not  found,  it uses the file xserverrc in the xinit library directory.
       If command line server options are given, they override  this  behavior
       and  revert  to  the xinit(1) behavior.  Users rarely need to provide a
       .xserverrc file.  See the xinit(1) manual page for more details on  the
       arguments.

       The   system-wide   xinitrc  and  xserverrc  files  are  found  in  the

       declaration has the following form:

       public static void main(String args[])


       By default, the first argument without an option is  the  name  of  the
       class to be called. A fully qualified class name should be used. If the

piconv
This script was primarily a
       technology demonstrator for Perl 5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the
       place of iconv for virtually any case.

       piconv converts the character encoding of either STDIN or files
       specified in the argument and prints out to STDOUT.

       Here is the list of options.  Each option can be in short format (-f)
       or long (--from).

       -f,--from from_encoding
           Specifies the encoding you are converting from.  Unlike iconv, this
           option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.

       -t,--to to_encoding
           Specifies the encoding you are converting to.  Unlike iconv, this
           option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.

           Therefore, when both -f and -t are omitted, piconv just acts like
           cat.

       -s,--string string
           uses string instead of file for the source of text.

       -l,--list
           Lists all available encodings, one per line, in case-insensitive
           order.  Note that only the canonical names are listed; many aliases
           exist.  For example, the names are case-insensitive, and many
           standard and common aliases work, such as "latin1" for
           "ISO-8859-1", or "ibm850" instead of "cp850", or "winlatin1" for

     as ssh(1).  Unlike rcp(1), scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if
     they are needed for authentication.

     File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate that the
     file is to be copied to/from that host.  Local file names can be made
     explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file
     names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.  Copies between two remote hosts
     are also permitted.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      Forces scp to use protocol 1.

     -2      Forces scp to use protocol 2.

     -3      Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local
             host.  Without this option the data is copied directly between
             the two remote hosts.  Note that this option disables the
             progress meter.

     -4      Forces scp to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces scp to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -B      Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
             passphrases).

     -C      Compression enable.  Passes the -C flag to ssh(1) to enable com‐
             pression.

     -c cipher
             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
             option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -F ssh_config
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -i identity_file
             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public
             key authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to

The tool is limited to reporting informa‐

       If jps is run without specifying a hostid, it  will  look  for  instru‐
       mented  JVMs  on the local host. If started with a hostid, it will look
       for JVMs on the indicated host, using the specified protocol and  port.
       A jstatd process is assumed to be running on the target host.

       The jps command will report the local VM identifier, or lvmid, for each
       instrumented JVM found on the target system. The  lvmid  is  typically,
       but  not necessarily, the operating system's process identifier for the
       JVM process. With no options, jps will  list  each  Java  application's
       lvmid followed by the short form of the application's class name or jar
       file name. The short form of the class name or JAR file name omits  the
       class's package information or the JAR files path information.

       The jps command uses the java launcher to find the class name and argu‐
       ments passed to the main method. If the target JVM is  started  with  a
       custom launcher, the class name (or JAR file name) and the arguments to
       the main method will not be available. In this case,  the  jps  command
       will  output the string Unknown for the class name or JAR file name and
       for the arguments to the main method.

       The list of JVMs produced by the jps command may be limited by the per‐
       missions granted to the principal running the command. The command will
       only list the JVMs for which the principle has access rights as  deter‐
       mined by operating system specific access control mechanisms.

     -b      Do not output any backspaces, printing only the last character
             written to each column position.

     -f      Forward half line feeds are permitted (``fine'' mode).  Normally
             characters printed on a half line boundary are printed on the
             following line.

     -h      Do not output multiple spaces instead of tabs (default).

     -l num  Buffer at least num lines in memory.  By default, 128 lines are
             buffered.

     -p      Force unknown control sequences to be passed through unchanged.
             Normally, col will filter out any control sequences from the
             input other than those recognized and interpreted by itself,
             which are listed below.

     -x      Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.

     The control sequences for carriage motion that col understands and their
     decimal values are listed in the following table:

     ESC-7            reverse line feed (escape then 7)
     ESC-8            half reverse line feed (escape then 8)
     ESC-9            half forward line feed (escape then 9)
     backspace        moves back one column (8); ignored in the first column
     carriage return  (13)
     newline          forward line feed (10); also does carriage return
     shift in         shift to normal character set (15)
     shift out        shift to alternate character set (14)
     space            moves forward one column (32)
     tab              moves forward to next tab stop (9)
     vertical tab     reverse line feed (11)

     All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences are discarded.

     The col utility keeps track of the character set as characters are read
     and makes sure the character set is correct when they are output.

     access to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the scanning
     process involve any encryption.

     The options are as follows:

     -4      Forces ssh-keyscan to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Forces ssh-keyscan to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -f file
             Read hosts or “addrlist namelist” pairs from file, one per line.
             If - is supplied instead of a filename, ssh-keyscan will read
             hosts or “addrlist namelist” pairs from the standard input.

     -H      Hash all hostnames and addresses in the output.  Hashed names may
             be used normally by ssh and sshd, but they do not reveal identi‐
             fying information should the file's contents be disclosed.

     -p port
             Port to connect to on the remote host.

     -T timeout
             Set the timeout for connection attempts.  If timeout seconds have
             elapsed since a connection was initiated to a host or since the
             last time anything was read from that host, then the connection
             is closed and the host in question considered unavailable.
             Default is 5 seconds.

     -t type
             Specifies the type of the key to fetch from the scanned hosts.
             The possible values are “rsa1” for protocol version 1 and “dsa”,
             “ecdsa”, “ed25519”, or “rsa” for protocol version 2.  Multiple
             values may be specified by separating them with commas.  The
             default is to fetch “rsa” and “ecdsa” keys.

     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh-keyscan to print debugging messages
             about its progress.

unxz
The native file format is the .xz
       format, but the legacy .lzma format used by LZMA  Utils  and  raw  com‐
       pressed streams with no container format headers are also supported.

       xz compresses or decompresses each file according to the selected oper‐
       ation mode.  If no files are given or file is -, xz reads from standard
       input and writes the processed data to standard output.  xz will refuse
       (display an error and skip the file) to write compressed data to  stan‐
       dard  output  if  it  is a terminal.  Similarly, xz will refuse to read
       compressed data from standard input if it is a terminal.

       Unless --stdout is specified, files other than - are written to  a  new
       file whose name is derived from the source file name:

       ·  When  compressing,  the  suffix  of  the  target file format (.xz or
          .lzma) is appended to the source filename to get  the  target  file‐
          name.

       ·  When  decompressing,  the  .xz  or  .lzma suffix is removed from the
          filename to get the target filename.  xz also  recognizes  the  suf‐
          fixes .txz and .tlz, and replaces them with the .tar suffix.

       If  the  target file already exists, an error is displayed and the file
       is skipped.

       Unless writing to standard output, xz will display a warning  and  skip
       the file if any of the following applies:

       ·  File  is  not  a regular file.  Symbolic links are not followed, and
          thus they are not considered to be regular files.

       ·  File has more than one hard link.

       ·  File has setuid, setgid, or sticky bit set.

       ·  The operation mode is set to compress and the  file  already  has  a
          suffix  of  the  target file format (.xz or .txz when compressing to
          the .xz format, and .lzma or .tlz when compressing to the .lzma for‐
          mat).

       ·  The  operation mode is set to decompress and the file doesn't have a
          suffix of any of the supported file formats (.xz,  .txz,  .lzma,  or
          .tlz).

       After successfully compressing or decompressing the file, xz copies the
       owner, group, permissions, access time, and modification time from  the
       source  file  to the target file.  If copying the group fails, the per‐
       missions are modified so that the target file doesn't become accessible
       to  users  who  didn't  have  permission to access the source file.  xz
       doesn't support copying other metadata like  access  control  lists  or
       extended attributes yet.

       Once  the  target file has been successfully closed, the source file is
       removed unless --keep was specified.  The source file is never  removed
       if the output is written to standard output.

       Sending  SIGINFO  or  SIGUSR1 to the xz process makes it print progress
       information to standard error.  This has only limited  use  since  when
       standard error is a terminal, using --verbose will display an automati‐
       cally updating progress indicator.

   Memory usage
       The memory usage of xz varies from a few hundred kilobytes  to  several
       gigabytes  depending  on  the  compression settings.  The settings used
       when compressing a file determine the memory requirements of the decom‐
       pressor.  Typically the decompressor needs 5 % to 20 % of the amount of
       memory that the compressor needed when creating the file.  For example,
       decompressing  a  file  created with xz -9 currently requires 65 MiB of
       memory.  Still, it is possible to have .xz files that  require  several
       gigabytes of memory to decompress.

       Especially  users  of  older  systems  may find the possibility of very
       large memory usage annoying.  To prevent  uncomfortable  surprises,  xz
       has  a  built-in  memory  usage  limiter, which is disabled by default.
       While some operating systems provide ways to limit the memory usage  of
       processes,  relying  on  it  wasn't  deemed to be flexible enough (e.g.
       using ulimit(1) to limit virtual memory tends to cripple mmap(2)).

       The memory usage limiter can be enabled with the  command  line  option
       --memlimit=limit.  Often it is more convenient to enable the limiter by
       default  by  setting  the  environment   variable   XZ_DEFAULTS,   e.g.
       XZ_DEFAULTS=--memlimit=150MiB.   It is possible to set the limits sepa‐
       rately for  compression  and  decompression  by  using  --memlimit-com‐
       press=limit  and  --memlimit-decompress=limit.  Using these two options
       outside XZ_DEFAULTS is rarely useful because a single run of xz  cannot
       do  both  compression  and  decompression  and  --memlimit=limit (or -

       brackets and prefixing them with the repetition count, e.g.

           init-+-getty
                |-getty
                |-getty
                `-getty

       becomes

           init---4*[getty]


       Child threads of a process are found under the parent process  and  are
       shown with the process name in curly braces, e.g.

           icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]


       If  pstree  is called as pstree.x11 then it will prompt the user at the
       end of the line to press return and will not return until that has hap‐
       pened.  This is useful for when pstree is run in a xterminal.

       Certain  kernel  or  mount  parameters,  such as the hidepid option for
       procfs, will hide information for some processes. In  these  situations
       pstree will attempt to build the tree without this information, showing
       process names as question marks.

It can be used
       to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful  for  editing
       programs.

       There  are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi win‐
       dows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line  editing,  filename
       completion,   on-line   help,   visual  selection,  etc..   See  ":help
       vi_diff.txt" for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

       While running Vim a lot of help can be obtained from the  on-line  help
       system, with the ":help" command.  See the ON-LINE HELP section below.

       Most often Vim is started to edit a single file with the command

            vim file

       More generally Vim is started with:

            vim [options] [filelist]

       If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
       Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used  to  choose
       one or more files to be edited.

       file ..     A  list  of  filenames.   The first one will be the current
                   file and read into the buffer.  The cursor  will  be  posi‐
                   tioned on the first line of the buffer.  You can get to the
                   other files with the ":next" command.  To edit a file  that
                   starts with a dash, precede the filelist with "--".

       -           The  file  to  edit  is read from stdin.  Commands are read
                   from stderr, which should be a tty.

       -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on
                   a  "tag",  a sort of goto label.  {tag} is looked up in the
                   tags file, the associated file becomes the current file and
                   the  associated  command  is executed.  Mostly this is used
                   for C programs, in which case {tag}  could  be  a  function
                   name.  The effect is that the file containing that function
                   becomes the current file and the cursor  is  positioned  on
                   the start of the function.  See ":help tag-commands".

       -q [errorfile]
                   Start  in  quickFix mode.  The file [errorfile] is read and
                   the first error is displayed.  If [errorfile]  is  omitted,
                   the  filename  is  obtained  from  the  'errorfile'  option
                   (defaults to "AztecC.Err" for the  Amiga,  "errors.err"  on
                   other  systems).   Further errors can be jumped to with the
                   ":cn" command.  See ":help quickfix".

       Vim behaves differently, depending on the name of the command (the exe‐
       cutable may still be the same file).

       vim       The "normal" way, everything is default.

       ex        Start  in Ex mode.  Go to Normal mode with the ":vi" command.
                 Can also be done with the "-e" argument.

       view      Start in read-only mode.  You will be protected from  writing
                 the files.  Can also be done with the "-R" argument.

       gvim gview
                 The GUI version.  Starts a new window.  Can also be done with
                 the "-g" argument.

       evim eview
                 The GUI version in easy mode.  Starts a new window.  Can also
                 be done with the "-y" argument.

       rvim rview rgvim rgview
                 Like the above, but with restrictions.  It will not be possi‐
                 ble to start shell commands, or suspend  Vim.   Can  also  be
                 done with the "-Z" argument.

pdftocairo
The image formats (PNG, JPEG, and TIFF) generate one file per page with
       the page number and file type  appended  to  output-file  (except  when
       -singlefile  is used).  When the output format is a vector format (PDF,
       PS, EPS, and SVG) or when -singlefile is used, output-file is the  full
       filename.

       If  the  PDF-file  is “-” , the PDF is read from stdin.  If the output-
       file is “-” , the output file will be written to stdout.  Using  stdout
       is not valid with image formats unless -singlefile is used.  If output-
       file is not used, the output filename will be derived from the PDF-file
       filename.

       Not  all  options are valid with all output formats. One (and only one)
       of the output format options (-png, -jpeg, -tiff, -pdf, -ps,  -eps,  or
       -svg) must be used.

       The  resolution  options (-r, -rx, -ry) set the resolution of the image
       output formats. The image dimensions will depend on the PDF  page  size
       and  the  resolution.  For the vector outputs, regions of the page that
       can not be represented natively in the output format  (eg  translucency
       in PS) will be rasterized at the resolution specified by the resolution
       options.

       The -scale-to options may be used to set a fixed image size. The  image
       resolution will vary with the page size.

       The  cropping options (-x, -y, -W, and -H) use units of pixels with the
       image formats and PostScript points (1/72 inch) with  the  vector  for‐
       mats.  When  cropping  is used with vector output the cropped region is
       centered unless -nocenter is used in which case the cropped  region  is
       at the top left (SVG) or bottom left (PDF, PS, EPS).

Older versions of file are named:

              file.<number><compress_suffix>

       where <number> is the version number, 0 being the newest.  Version num‐
       bers > 0 are compressed unless -l prevents it.  Version number 0 is not
       compressed because a process might still  have  file  opened  for  I/O.
       Only cycle versions of the file are kept.

       If the file does not exist and -t was given, it will be created.

       For files that do exist and have lengths greater than zero, the follow‐
       ing actions are performed:


       1)     Version numbered files are cycled.  Version file.2 is  moved  to
              version  file.3,  version file.1 is moved to version file.2, and
              so on.  Finally version file.0 is moved to version  file.1,  and
              version file is deleted.  Both compressed names and uncompressed
              names are cycled, regardless of -l.  Missing version  files  are
              ignored.


       2)     The  new  file.1 is compressed unless the -l flag was given.  It
              is changed subject to the -m, -u, and -g flags.


       3)     The main file is moved to file.0.


       4)     If the -m, -u, -g,  -t, or -p flags are  given,  then  an  empty
              file  is  created subject to the given flags.  With the -p flag,
              the file is created with the same owner, group, and  permissions
              as before.

       The advantage of using keysyms is that the config file is easy to read,
       understand and modify. However, if we shipped with a keysym based
       default config file, the key positions would not be consistent across
       different keyboard layouts (take for example the homerow for movement).
       Therefore, we ship with a keycode based default config and let the
       wizard transform it according to your current keyboard layout.

ftp
The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a remote
     network site.

     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command inter‐
     preter.

     -4    Use only IPv4 to contact any host.

     -6    Use IPv6 only.

     -p    Use passive mode for data transfers. Allows use of ftp in environ‐
           ments where a firewall prevents connections from the outside world
           back to the client machine. Requires that the ftp server support
           the PASV command. This is the default if invoked as pftp.

     -i    Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     -n    Restrains ftp from attempting “auto-login” upon initial connection.
           If auto-login is enabled, ftp will check the .netrc (see netrc(5))
           file in the user's home directory for an entry describing an
           account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists, ftp will prompt
           for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on
           the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an
           account with which to login.

     -e    Disables command editing and history support, if it was compiled
           into the ftp executable. Otherwise, does nothing.

     -g    Disables file name globbing.

     -v    Verbose option forces ftp to show all responses from the remote
           server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     -d    Enables debugging.

     The client host and an optional port number with which ftp is to communi‐
     cate may be specified on the command line.  If this is done, ftp will
     immediately attempt to establish a connection to an FTP server on that
     host; otherwise, ftp will enter its command interpreter and await
     instructions from the user.  When ftp is awaiting commands from the user
     the prompt ‘ftp>’ is provided to the user.  The following commands are
     recognized by ftp:

     ! [command [args]]
                 Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there
                 are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
                 directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

     $ macro-name [args]
                 Execute the macro macro-name that was defined with the macdef
                 command.  Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.

     account [passwd]
                 Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
                 for access to resources once a login has been successfully
                 completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be
                 prompted for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

     append local-file [remote-file]
                 Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If
                 remote-file is left unspecified, the local file name is used
                 in naming the remote file after being altered by any ntrans
                 or nmap setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for
                 type, format, mode, and structure.

     ascii       Set the file transfer type to network ASCII.  This is the
                 default type.

     bell        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer com‐
                 mand is completed.

     binary      Set the file transfer type to support binary image transfer.

     bye         Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit
                 ftp.  An end of file will also terminate the session and
                 exit.

     case        Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during mget
                 commands.  When case is on (default is off), remote computer
                 file names with all letters in upper case are written in the
                 local directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

     cd remote-directory
                 Change the working directory on the remote machine to
                 remote-directory.

     cdup        Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of
                 the current remote machine working directory.

     chmod mode file-name
                 Change the permission modes of the file file-name on the
                 remote sytem to mode.

     close       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return
                 to the command interpreter.  Any defined macros are erased.

     cr          Toggle carriage return stripping during ascii type file
                 retrieval.  Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed
                 sequence during ascii type file transfer.  When cr is on (the
                 default), carriage returns are stripped from this sequence to
                 conform with the UNIX single linefeed record delimiter.
                 Records on non-UNIX remote systems may contain single line‐
                 feeds; when an ascii type transfer is made, these linefeeds
                 may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when cr is
                 off.

     qc          Toggle the printing of control characters in the output of
                 ASCII type commands.  When this is turned on, control charac‐
                 ters are replaced with a question mark if the output file is
                 the standard output.  This is the default when the standard
                 output is a tty.

     delete remote-file
                 Delete the file remote-file on the remote machine.

     debug [debug-value]
                 Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional debug-value is speci‐
                 fied it is used to set the debugging level.  When debugging
                 is on, ftp prints each command sent to the remote machine,
                 preceded by the string ‘-->’

     dir [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a listing of the directory contents in the directory,
                 remote-directory, and, optionally, placing the output in
                 local-file.  If interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt
                 the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the tar‐
                 get local file for receiving dir output.  If no directory is
                 specified, the current working directory on the remote
                 machine is used.  If no local file is specified, or
                 local-file is -, output comes to the terminal.

     disconnect  A synonym for close.

     form format
                 Set the file transfer form to format.  The default format is
                 “file”.

     get remote-file [local-file]
                 Retrieve the remote-file and store it on the local machine.
                 If the local file name is not specified, it is given the same
                 name it has on the remote machine, subject to alteration by
                 the current case, ntrans, and nmap settings.  The current
                 settings for type, form, mode, and structure are used while
                 transferring the file.

     glob        Toggle filename expansion for mdelete, mget and mput.  If
                 globbing is turned off with glob, the file name arguments are
                 taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for mput is done
                 as in csh(1).  For mdelete and mget, each remote file name is
                 expanded separately on the remote machine and the lists are
                 not merged.  Expansion of a directory name is likely to be
                 different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the
                 exact result depends on the foreign operating system and ftp
                 server, and can be previewed by doing ‘mls remote-files -’
                 Note: mget and mput are not meant to transfer entire direc‐
                 tory subtrees of files.  That can be done by transferring a
                 tar(1) archive of the subtree (in binary mode).

     hash        Toggle hash-sign (``#'') printing for each data block trans‐
                 ferred.  The size of a data block is 1024 bytes.

     help [command]
                 Print an informative message about the meaning of command.
                 If no argument is given, ftp prints a list of the known com‐
                 mands.

     idle [seconds]
                 Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to seconds sec‐
                 onds.  If seconds is omitted, the current inactivity timer is
                 printed.

     ipany       Allow the address resolver to return any address family.

     ipv4        Restrict the address resolver to look only for IPv4
                 addresses.

     ipv6        Restrict host adressing to IPv6 only.

     lcd [directory]
                 Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no
                 directory is specified, the user's home directory is used.

     ls [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
                 machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent informa‐
                 tion that the server chooses to include; for example, most
                 UNIX systems will produce output from the command ‘ls -l’.
                 (See also nlist.)  If remote-directory is left unspecified,
                 the current working directory is used.  If interactive
                 prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the
                 last argument is indeed the target local file for receiving
                 ls output.  If no local file is specified, or if local-file
                 is ‘-’, the output is sent to the terminal.

     macdef macro-name
                 Define a macro.  Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
                 macro-name; a null line (consecutive newline characters in a
                 file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates macro
                 input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total
                 characters in all defined macros.  Macros remain defined
                 until a close command is executed.  The macro processor
                 interprets `$' and `\' as special characters.  A `$' followed
                 by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding
                 argument on the macro invocation command line.  A `$' fol‐
                 lowed by an `i' signals that macro processor that the execut‐
                 ing macro is to be looped.  On the first pass `$i' is
                 replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation com‐
                 mand line, on the second pass it is replaced by the second
                 argument, and so on.  A `\' followed by any character is
                 replaced by that character.  Use the `\' to prevent special
                 treatment of the `$'.

     mdelete [remote-files]
                 Delete the remote-files on the remote machine.

     mdir remote-files local-file
                 Like dir, except multiple remote files may be specified.  If
                 interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to ver‐
                 ify that the last argument is indeed the target local file
                 for receiving mdir output.

     mget remote-files
                 Expand the remote-files on the remote machine and do a get
                 for each file name thus produced.  See glob for details on
                 the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be
                 processed according to case, ntrans, and nmap settings.
                 Files are transferred into the local working directory, which
                 can be changed with ‘lcd directory’; new local directories
                 can be created with ‘! mkdir directory’.

     mkdir directory-name
                 Make a directory on the remote machine.

     mls remote-files local-file
                 Like nlist, except multiple remote files may be specified,
                 and the local-file must be specified.  If interactive prompt‐
                 ing is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last
                 argument is indeed the target local file for receiving mls
                 output.

     mode [mode-name]
                 Set the file transfer mode to mode-name.  The default mode is
                 “stream” mode.

     modtime file-name
                 Show the last modification time of the file on the remote
                 machine.

     mput local-files
                 Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as argu‐
                 ments and do a put for each file in the resulting list.  See
                 glob for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file names
                 will then be processed according to ntrans and nmap settings.

     newer file-name [local-file]
                 Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file
                 is more recent that the file on the current system.  If the
                 file does not exist on the current system, the remote file is
                 considered newer.  Otherwise, this command is identical to
                 get.

     nlist [remote-directory] [local-file]
                 Print a  list of the files in a directory on the remote
                 machine.  If remote-directory is left unspecified, the cur‐
                 rent working directory is used.  If interactive prompting is
                 on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the last argument
                 is indeed the target local file for receiving nlist output.
                 If no local file is specified, or if local-file is -, the
                 output is sent to the terminal.

     nmap [inpattern outpattern]
                 Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments
                 are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset.  If
                 arguments are specified, remote filenames are mapped during
                 mput commands and put commands issued without a specified
                 remote target filename.  If arguments are specified, local
                 filenames are mapped during mget commands and get commands
                 issued without a specified local target filename.  This com‐
                 mand is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer
                 with different file naming conventions or practices.  The
                 mapping follows the pattern set by inpattern and outpattern.
                 [Inpattern] is a template for incoming filenames (which may
                 have already been processed according to the ntrans and case
                 settings).  Variable templating is accomplished by including
                 the sequences `$1', `$2', ..., `$9' in inpattern.  Use `\' to
                 prevent this special treatment of the `$' character.  All
                 other characters are treated literally, and are used to
                 determine the nmap [inpattern] variable values.  For example,
                 given inpattern $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data",
                 $1 would have the value "mydata", and $2 would have the value
                 "data".  The outpattern determines the resulting mapped file‐
                 name.  The sequences `$1', `$2', ...., `$9' are replaced by
                 any value resulting from the inpattern template.  The
                 sequence `$0' is replace by the original filename.  Addition‐
                 ally, the sequence ‘[seq1, seq2]’ is replaced by [seq1] if
                 seq1 is not a null string; otherwise it is replaced by seq2.
                 For example, the command

                       nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

                 would yield the output filename "myfile.data" for input file‐
                 names "myfile.data" and "myfile.data.old", "myfile.file" for
                 the input filename "myfile", and "myfile.myfile" for the
                 input filename ".myfile".  Spaces may be included in
                 outpattern, as in the example: `nmap $1 sed "s/  *$//" > $1'
                 .  Use the `\' character to prevent special treatment of the
                 `$','[','[', and `,' characters.

     ntrans [inchars [outchars]]
                 Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
                 If no arguments are specified, the filename character trans‐
                 lation mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, char‐
                 acters in remote filenames are translated during mput com‐
                 mands and put commands issued without a specified remote tar‐
                 get filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in
                 local filenames are translated during mget commands and get
                 commands issued without a specified local target filename.
                 This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
                 computer with different file naming conventions or practices.
                 Characters in a filename matching a character in inchars are
                 replaced with the corresponding character in outchars.  If
                 the character's position in inchars is longer than the length
                 of outchars, the character is deleted from the file name.

     open host [port]
                 Establish a connection to the specified host FTP server.  An
                 optional port number may be supplied, in which case, ftp will
                 attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the
                 auto-login option is on (default), ftp will also attempt to
                 automatically log the user in to the FTP server (see below).

     prompt      Toggle interactive prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs
                 during multiple file transfers to allow the user to selec‐
                 tively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off
                 (default is on), any mget or mput will transfer all files,
                 and any mdelete will delete all files.

     proxy ftp-command
                 Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.
                 This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote ftp
                 servers for transferring files between the two servers.  The
                 first proxy command should be an open, to establish the sec‐
                 ondary control connection.  Enter the command "proxy ?" to
                 see other ftp commands executable on the secondary connec‐
                 tion.  The following commands behave differently when pref‐
                 aced by proxy: open will not define new macros during the
                 auto-login process, close will not erase existing macro defi‐
                 nitions, get and mget transfer files from the host on the
                 primary control connection to the host on the secondary con‐
                 trol connection, and put, mput, and append transfer files
                 from the host on the secondary control connection to the host
                 on the primary control connection.  Third party file trans‐
                 fers depend upon support of the ftp protocol PASV command by
                 the server on the secondary control connection.

     put local-file [remote-file]
                 Store a local file on the remote machine.  If remote-file is
                 left unspecified, the local file name is used after process‐
                 ing according to any ntrans or nmap settings in naming the

ssh-keygen
ssh-keygen can create RSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 1
     and DSA, ECDSA, ED25519 or RSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 2.
     The type of key to be generated is specified with the -t option.  If
     invoked without any arguments, ssh-keygen will generate an RSA key for
     use in SSH protocol 2 connections.

     ssh-keygen is also used to generate groups for use in Diffie-Hellman
     group exchange (DH-GEX).  See the MODULI GENERATION section for details.

     Finally, ssh-keygen can be used to generate and update Key Revocation
     Lists, and to test whether given keys have been revoked by one.  See the
     KEY REVOCATION LISTS section for details.

     Normally each user wishing to use SSH with public key authentication runs
     this once to create the authentication key in ~/.ssh/identity,
     ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 or ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
     Additionally, the system administrator may use this to generate host
     keys.

     Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which to
     store the private key.  The public key is stored in a file with the same
     name but “.pub” appended.  The program also asks for a passphrase.  The
     passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have an
     empty passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length.

x86_64-linux-gnu-cpp
It is called a macro processor because it allows you to
       define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.

       The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and
       Objective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a general
       text processor.  It will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical
       rules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning
       of character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it
       preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to
       C-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs
       will be removed, and the Makefile will not work.

       Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which
       are not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe
       (Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.  -traditional-cpp
       mode preserves more white space, and is otherwise more permissive.
       Many of the problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments
       instead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.

       Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language
       you are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro
       facilities.  Most high level programming languages have their own
       conditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails,
       try a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.

lessfile
This manual page was written  for  the  Debian  GNU/Linux  distribution
       because the input preprocessor scripts are provided by Debian GNU/Linux
       and are not part of the original program.

       lessfile and lesspipe are programs that can be used to modify  the  way
       the  contents of a file are displayed in less.  What this means is that
       less can automatically open up tar files, uncompress gzipped files, and
       even display something reasonable for graphics files.

       lesspipe  will toss the contents/info on STDOUT and less will read them
       as they come across.  This means that you do not have to wait  for  the
       decoding  to  finish  before  less shows you the file.  This also means
       that you will get a 'byte N' instead of an N% as  your  file  position.
       You  can seek to the end and back to get the N% but that means you have
       to wait for the pipe to finish.

       lessfile will toss the contents/info on a file  which  less  will  then
       read.   After  you  are done, lessfile will then delete the file.  This
       means that the process has to finish before you see  it,  but  you  get
       nice percentages (N%) up front.

apt-mark
When you request that a package is installed, and as a result other
       packages are installed to satisfy its dependencies, the dependencies
       are marked as being automatically installed. Once these automatically
       installed packages are no longer depended on by any manually installed
       packages, they will be removed by e.g.  apt-get or aptitude.

       auto
           auto is used to mark a package as being automatically installed,
           which will cause the package to be removed when no more manually
           installed packages depend on this package.

       manual
           manual is used to mark a package as being manually installed, which
           will prevent the package from being automatically removed if no
           other packages depend on it.

       hold
           hold is used to mark a package as held back, which will prevent the
           package from being automatically installed, upgraded or removed.
           The command is only a wrapper around dpkg --set-selections and the
           state is therefore maintained by dpkg(1) and not affected by the
           --file option.

       unhold
           unhold is used to cancel a previously set hold on a package to
           allow all actions again.

       showauto
           showauto is used to print a list of automatically installed
           packages with each package on a new line. All automatically
           installed packages will be listed if no package is given. If
           packages are given only those which are automatically installed
           will be shown.

       showmanual
           showmanual can be used in the same way as showauto except that it
           will print a list of manually installed packages instead.

       showhold
           showhold is used to print a list of packages on hold in the same
           way as for the other show commands.

deb-systemd-helper
The "enable" action will only be performed once (when first installing
       the package). On the first "enable", an state file is created which
       will be deleted upon "disable", but only when
       _DEB_SYSTEMD_HELPER_PURGE=1 to distinguish purge from remove.

       The "mask" action will keep state on whether the service was
       enabled/disabled before and will properly return to that state on
       "unmask".

       The "was-enabled" action is not present in systemctl, but is required
       in Debian so that we can figure out whether a service was enabled
       before we installed an updated service file. See
       http://bugs.debian.org/717603 for details.

       The "debian-installed" action is also not present in systemctl. It
       returns 0 if the state file of at least one of the given units is
       present.

       The "update-state" action is also not present in systemctl. It updates
       deb-systemd-helper's state file, removing obsolete entries (e.g.
       service files that are no longer shipped by the package) and adding new
       entries (e.g.  new service files shipped by the package) without
       enabling them.

       deb-systemd-helper is intended to be used from maintscripts to enable
       systemd unit files. It is specifically NOT intended to be used
       interactively by users. Instead, users should run systemd and use
       systemctl, or not bother about the systemd enabled state in case they
       are not running systemd.

infocmp
In all cases, the  boolean
       fields  will be printed first, followed by the numeric fields, followed
       by the string fields.

   Default Options
       If no options are specified and zero or one  termnames  are  specified,
       the -I option will be assumed.  If more than one termname is specified,
       the -d option will be assumed.

   Comparison Options [-d] [-c] [-n]
       infocmp  compares  the  terminfo  description  of  the  first  terminal
       termname  with  each  of  the descriptions given by the entries for the
       other terminal's termnames.  If a capability is defined for only one of
       the  terminals, the value returned will depend on the type of the capa‐
       bility: F for boolean variables, -1 for integer variables, and NULL for
       string variables.

       The  -d  option  produces  a  list of each capability that is different
       between two entries.  This option is  useful  to  show  the  difference
       between two entries, created by different people, for the same or simi‐
       lar terminals.

       The -c option produces a list of each capability that is common between
       two  or more entries.  Capabilities that are not set are ignored.  This
       option can be used as a quick check to see if the -u  option  is  worth
       using.

       The -n option produces a list of each capability that is in none of the
       given entries.  If no termnames are  given,  the  environment  variable
       TERM  will  be  used  for both of the termnames.  This can be used as a
       quick check to see if anything was left out of a description.

   Source Listing Options [-I] [-L] [-C] [-r]
       The -I, -L, and -C options will produce a source listing for each  ter‐
       minal named.

            -I   use the terminfo names
            -L   use the long C variable name listed in <term.h>
            -C   use the termcap names
            -r   when using -C, put out all capabilities in termcap form
            -K   modifies the -C option, improving BSD-compatibility.

       If  no  termnames are given, the environment variable TERM will be used
       for the terminal name.

       The source produced by the -C option may be used directly as a  termcap
       entry,  but not all parameterized strings can be changed to the termcap
       format.  infocmp will attempt to  convert  most  of  the  parameterized
       information,  and  anything not converted will be plainly marked in the
       output and commented out.  These should be edited by hand.

       For best results when converting to termcap format, you should use both
       -C  and  -r.   Normally a termcap description is limited to 1023 bytes.
       infocmp trims away less essential parts to make it  fit.   If  you  are
       converting to one of the (rare) termcap implementations which accept an
       unlimited size of termcap, you may want to add  the  -T  option.   More
       often  however,  you  must  help  the  termcap implementation, and trim
       excess whitespace (use the -0 option for that).

       All padding information for strings  will  be  collected  together  and
       placed at the beginning of the string where termcap expects it.  Manda‐
       tory padding (padding information with  a  trailing  '/')  will  become
       optional.

       All  termcap  variables  no longer supported by terminfo, but which are
       derivable from other terminfo variables, will be output.  Not all  ter‐
       minfo  capabilities will be translated; only those variables which were
       part of termcap will normally be output.  Specifying the -r option will
       take  off  this  restriction, allowing all capabilities to be output in
       termcap form.  Normally you would use both the -C and -r options.   The
       actual  format  used incorporates some improvements for escaped charac‐
       ters from terminfo format.  For a stricter BSD-compatible  translation,
       use the -K option rather than -C.

       Note that because padding is collected to the beginning of the capabil‐
       ity, not all capabilities are output.  Mandatory padding  is  not  sup‐
       ported.   Because termcap strings are not as flexible, it is not always
       possible to convert a terminfo string  capability  into  an  equivalent
       termcap  format.  A subsequent conversion of the termcap file back into
       terminfo format will not necessarily reproduce  the  original  terminfo
       source.

       Some  common  terminfo  parameter sequences, their termcap equivalents,
       and some terminal types which commonly have such sequences, are:

           terminfo                    termcap   Representative Terminals

           %p2 is printed before %p1   %r        hp

   Use= Option [-u]
       The -u option produces a terminfo source description of the first  ter‐
       minal  termname  which is relative to the sum of the descriptions given
       by the entries for the other terminals termnames.  It does this by ana‐
       lyzing  the  differences  between  the  first  termname  and  the other
       termnames and producing a description with use= fields  for  the  other
       terminals.  In this manner, it is possible to retrofit generic terminfo
       entries into a terminal's description.  Or, if  two  similar  terminals
       exist, but were coded at different times or by different people so that
       each description is a full description, using infocmp  will  show  what
       can be done to change one description to be relative to the other.

       A  capability  will  get  printed  with  an at-sign (@) if it no longer
       exists in the first termname, but one of  the  other  termname  entries
       contains  a  value  for  it.   A capability's value gets printed if the
       value in the first termname is not found in any of the  other  termname
       entries,  or  if  the first of the other termname entries that has this
       capability gives a different value for the capability than that in  the
       first termname.

       The order of the other termname entries is significant.  Since the ter‐
       minfo compiler tic does a left-to-right scan of the capabilities, spec‐
       ifying  two  use=  entries  that contain differing entries for the same
       capabilities will produce different results depending on the order that
       the  entries  are given in.  infocmp will flag any such inconsistencies
       between the other termname entries as they are found.

       Alternatively, specifying a capability after a use= entry that contains
       that  capability  will  cause  the  second specification to be ignored.
       Using infocmp to recreate a description can be a useful check  to  make
       sure  that  everything  was  specified correctly in the original source
       description.

       Another error that does not cause incorrect compiled  files,  but  will
       slow  down  the  compilation time, is specifying extra use= fields that
       are superfluous.  infocmp will flag any other termname use= fields that
       were not needed.

       tions in several places.  You can use the  TERMINFO  and  TERMINFO_

cpp-4.8
It is called a macro processor because it allows you to
       define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.

       The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and
       Objective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a general
       text processor.  It will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical
       rules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning
       of character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it
       preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to
       C-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs
       will be removed, and the Makefile will not work.

       Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which
       are not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe
       (Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.  -traditional-cpp
       mode preserves more white space, and is otherwise more permissive.
       Many of the problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments
       instead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.

       Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language
       you are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro
       facilities.  Most high level programming languages have their own
       conditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails,
       try a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.

       C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU

ucf
It uses debconf to interact with the user, as per Debian policy.
       In the SYNOPSIS above, New file is the configuration file  as  provided
       by  the  package  (either shipped with the package, or generated by the
       maintainer scripts on the fly), and Destination is the  location  (usu‐
       ally under /etc) where the real configuration file lives, and is poten‐
       tially modified by the end user.  As far as possible, ucf  attempts  to
       preserve  the  ownership and permission of the New file as it is copied
       to the new location.

       This script attempts  to  provide  conffile  like  handling  for  files
       installed  under  /etc  not shipped in a Debian package, but handled by
       the postinst instead.  Debian policy states that files under /etc which
       are configuration files must preserve user changes, and this applies to
       files handled by maintainer scripts as well. Using ucf, one may ship  a
       bunch   of   default   configuration   files   somewhere   in   /usr  (
       /usr/share/<pkg> is a good location), and maintain files in /etc,  pre‐
       serving  user changes and in general offering the same facilities while
       upgrading that dpkg normally provides for “conffiles”

       Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a  file
       that  had not been provided conffile like protection to come under this
       schema, and attempts to  minimize  questions  asked  at  install  time.
       Indeed,  the  transitioning  facility is better than the one offered by
       dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to conffile status.
       The  second form in the SYNOPSIS above is for purging information about
       the configuration file when the package is purged; and is critical  for
       allowing smooth reinstallations.

       During the course of operations, when working with configuration files,
       ucf optionally creates copies of versions of the configuration file  in
       question.  For  example,  a  file with the suffix ucf-old holds the old
       version of a configuration file replaced by ucf.  Also, copies  of  the
       configuration  file  with the suffixes ucf-new and ucf-dist may be cre‐
       ated; and the maintainer scripts should consider purging copies of  the
       configuration file with these extensions during purge.

       Pressing  the  "Run" button causes these results to be displayed in the
       large drawing window on the right.  Timing information is displayed  in
       the window immediately below.

       The items in the upper left hand window work as follows:

       Function  -  specify  the  logical  function with which primitives will
       drawn.  The most usual setting is "set", i.e. simply to  render  pixels
       without regard to what has been drawn before.

       LineStyle  - specify whether lines should be drawn solid in foreground,
       dashed in foreground or alternating foreground and background.

       CapStyle - specify the appearance of the ends of a line.

       JoinStyle - specify the appearance of joints between consecutive  lines
       drawn within a single graphics primitive.

       FillStyle  -  specify  whether lines, text and fill requests are solid,
       tiled with a pixmap or stippled.

       FillRule - specifies the rule used to fill polygons.  The EvenOdd  rule
       means that if areas overlap an odd number of times, they are not drawn.
       Winding rule means that overlapping areas are always filled, regardless
       of how many times they overlap.

       ArcMode  - specifies the rule for filling of arcs.  The boundary of the
       arc is either a Chord or two radii.

       planemask - specifies which planes of the drawing window are  modified.
       By default, all planes are modified.

       dashlist - specifies a pattern to be used when drawing dashed lines.

       Line  Width - specifies the width in pixels of lines to be drawn.  Zero
       means to draw using the server's fastest algorithm with a line width of
       one pixel.

       Font - specifies the font to be used for text primitives.

       Foreground and Background - specify the pixel values to be applied when
       drawing primitives.  The Foreground value is used as  the  pixel  value
       for  set bits in the source in all primitives.  The Background value is
       used as the pixel value for unset bits in the source  when  using  Copy
       Plane,  drawing  lines  with  LineStyle  of DoubleDash and filling with
       FillStyle of OpaqueStippled.

       Percentage of Test - scrollbar permits specifying only a percentage  of
       the  test to be run.  The number at the left indicates the current set‐
       ting, which defaults to 100%.

       The window labeled "Test" permits choice of one a  number  of  graphics
       primitive  tests,  including  Points,  Segments, Lines, Arcs and Filled
       Arcs, 8-bit Text and Image  Text,  Rectangles  and  Filled  Rectangles,

       preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to
       C-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs
       will be removed, and the Makefile will not work.

       Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which
       are not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe
       (Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.  -traditional-cpp
       mode preserves more white space, and is otherwise more permissive.
       Many of the problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments
       instead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.

       Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language
       you are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro
       facilities.  Most high level programming languages have their own
       conditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails,
       try a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.

       C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU

apt-ftparchive
The index files should
       be generated on the origin site based on the content of that site.

       apt-ftparchive is a superset of the dpkg-scanpackages(1) program,
       incorporating its entire functionality via the packages command. It
       also contains a contents file generator, contents, and an elaborate
       means to 'script' the generation process for a complete archive.

       Internally apt-ftparchive can make use of binary databases to cache the
       contents of a .deb file and it does not rely on any external programs
       aside from gzip(1). When doing a full generate it automatically
       performs file-change checks and builds the desired compressed output
       files.

       Unless the -h, or --help option is given, one of the commands below
       must be present.

       packages
           The packages command generates a package file from a directory
           tree. It takes the given directory and recursively searches it for
           .deb files, emitting a package record to stdout for each. This
           command is approximately equivalent to dpkg-scanpackages(1).

           The option --db can be used to specify a binary caching DB.

       sources
           The sources command generates a source index file from a directory
           tree. It takes the given directory and recursively searches it for
           .dsc files, emitting a source record to stdout for each. This
           command is approximately equivalent to dpkg-scansources(1).

           If an override file is specified then a source override file will
           be looked for with an extension of .src. The --source-override
           option can be used to change the source override file that will be
           used.

       contents
           The contents command generates a contents file from a directory
           tree. It takes the given directory and recursively searches it for
           .deb files, and reads the file list from each file. It then sorts
           and writes to stdout the list of files matched to packages.
           Directories are not written to the output. If multiple packages own
           the same file then each package is separated by a comma in the
           output.

           The option --db can be used to specify a binary caching DB.

       release
           The release command generates a Release file from a directory tree.
           It recursively searches the given directory for uncompressed
           Packages and Sources files and ones compressed with gzip, bzip2 or
           lzma as well as Release and md5sum.txt files by default
           (APT::FTPArchive::Release::Default-Patterns). Additional filename
           patterns can be added by listing them in
           APT::FTPArchive::Release::Patterns. It then writes to stdout a
           Release file containing an MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 digest for each
           file.

           Values for the additional metadata fields in the Release file are
           taken from the corresponding variables under
           APT::FTPArchive::Release, e.g.  APT::FTPArchive::Release::Origin.
           The supported fields are: Origin, Label, Suite, Version, Codename,
           Date, Valid-Until, Architectures, Components, Description.

       generate
           The generate command is designed to be runnable from a cron script
           and builds indexes according to the given config file. The config
           language provides a flexible means of specifying which index files
           are built from which directories, as well as providing a simple
           means of maintaining the required settings.

       clean
           The clean command tidies the databases used by the given
           configuration file by removing any records that are no longer
           necessary.

unlzma
The native file format is the .xz
       format, but the legacy .lzma format used by LZMA  Utils  and  raw  com‐
       pressed streams with no container format headers are also supported.

       xz compresses or decompresses each file according to the selected oper‐
       ation mode.  If no files are given or file is -, xz reads from standard
       input and writes the processed data to standard output.  xz will refuse
       (display an error and skip the file) to write compressed data to  stan‐
       dard  output  if  it  is a terminal.  Similarly, xz will refuse to read
       compressed data from standard input if it is a terminal.

       Unless --stdout is specified, files other than - are written to  a  new
       file whose name is derived from the source file name:

       ·  When  compressing,  the  suffix  of  the  target file format (.xz or
          .lzma) is appended to the source filename to get  the  target  file‐
          name.

       ·  When  decompressing,  the  .xz  or  .lzma suffix is removed from the
          filename to get the target filename.  xz also  recognizes  the  suf‐
          fixes .txz and .tlz, and replaces them with the .tar suffix.

       If  the  target file already exists, an error is displayed and the file
       is skipped.

       Unless writing to standard output, xz will display a warning  and  skip
       the file if any of the following applies:

       ·  File  is  not  a regular file.  Symbolic links are not followed, and
          thus they are not considered to be regular files.

       ·  File has more than one hard link.

       ·  File has setuid, setgid, or sticky bit set.

       ·  The operation mode is set to compress and the  file  already  has  a
          suffix  of  the  target file format (.xz or .txz when compressing to
          the .xz format, and .lzma or .tlz when compressing to the .lzma for‐
          mat).

       ·  The  operation mode is set to decompress and the file doesn't have a
          suffix of any of the supported file formats (.xz,  .txz,  .lzma,  or
          .tlz).

       After successfully compressing or decompressing the file, xz copies the
       owner, group, permissions, access time, and modification time from  the
       source  file  to the target file.  If copying the group fails, the per‐
       missions are modified so that the target file doesn't become accessible
       to  users  who  didn't  have  permission to access the source file.  xz
       doesn't support copying other metadata like  access  control  lists  or
       extended attributes yet.

       Once  the  target file has been successfully closed, the source file is
       removed unless --keep was specified.  The source file is never  removed
       if the output is written to standard output.

       Sending  SIGINFO  or  SIGUSR1 to the xz process makes it print progress
       information to standard error.  This has only limited  use  since  when
       standard error is a terminal, using --verbose will display an automati‐
       cally updating progress indicator.

   Memory usage
       The memory usage of xz varies from a few hundred kilobytes  to  several
       gigabytes  depending  on  the  compression settings.  The settings used
       when compressing a file determine the memory requirements of the decom‐
       pressor.  Typically the decompressor needs 5 % to 20 % of the amount of
       memory that the compressor needed when creating the file.  For example,
       decompressing  a  file  created with xz -9 currently requires 65 MiB of
       memory.  Still, it is possible to have .xz files that  require  several
       gigabytes of memory to decompress.

       Especially  users  of  older  systems  may find the possibility of very
       large memory usage annoying.  To prevent  uncomfortable  surprises,  xz
       has  a  built-in  memory  usage  limiter, which is disabled by default.
       While some operating systems provide ways to limit the memory usage  of
       processes,  relying  on  it  wasn't  deemed to be flexible enough (e.g.
       using ulimit(1) to limit virtual memory tends to cripple mmap(2)).

       The memory usage limiter can be enabled with the  command  line  option
       --memlimit=limit.  Often it is more convenient to enable the limiter by
       default  by  setting  the  environment   variable   XZ_DEFAULTS,   e.g.
       XZ_DEFAULTS=--memlimit=150MiB.   It is possible to set the limits sepa‐
       rately for  compression  and  decompression  by  using  --memlimit-com‐
       press=limit  and  --memlimit-decompress=limit.  Using these two options
       outside XZ_DEFAULTS is rarely useful because a single run of xz  cannot
       do  both  compression  and  decompression  and  --memlimit=limit (or -

partx
It optionally adds or removes partitions.

       The  disk  argument  is optional when a partition argument is provided.
       To force scanning a partition as if it were a whole disk  (for  example
       to list nested subpartitions), use the argument "-".  For example:

              partx --show - /dev/sda3

       This will see sda3 as a whole-disk rather than a partition.

       This is not an fdisk program -- adding and removing partitions does not
       change the disk, it just tells the kernel about the presence  and  num‐
       bering of on-disk partitions.

xrdb
You
       would normally run this program from your X startup file.

       Most X clients use the RESOURCE_MANAGER and SCREEN_RESOURCES properties
       to get user preferences about color, fonts, and so on for applications.
       Having this information in the server (where it  is  available  to  all
       clients) instead of on disk, solves the problem in previous versions of
       X that required you to maintain defaults files on  every  machine  that
       you might use.  It also allows for dynamic changing of defaults without
       editing files.

       The RESOURCE_MANAGER property is used for resources that apply  to  all
       screens  of  the display.  The SCREEN_RESOURCES property on each screen
       specifies additional (or overriding) resources  to  be  used  for  that
       screen.   (When  there is only one screen, SCREEN_RESOURCES is normally
       not used, all resources are just placed in the  RESOURCE_MANAGER  prop‐
       erty.)

       The  file specified by filename (or the contents from standard input if
       - or no filename is given) is optionally  passed  through  the  C  pre‐
       processor with the following symbols defined, based on the capabilities
       of the server being used:

       SERVERHOST=hostname
               the hostname portion of the display to which you are connected.

       SRVR_name
               the SERVERHOST hostname string turned into a legal  identifier.
               For         example,        "my-dpy.lcs.mit.edu"        becomes
               SRVR_my_dpy_lcs_mit_edu.

       HOST=hostname
               the same as SERVERHOST.

       DISPLAY_NUM=num
               the number of the display on the server host.

       CLIENTHOST=hostname
               the name of the host on which xrdb is running.

       CLNT_name
               the CLIENTHOST hostname string turned into a legal  identifier.
               For example, "expo.lcs.mit.edu" becomes CLNT_expo_lcs_mit_edu.

       RELEASE=num
               the  vendor  release number for the server.  The interpretation
               of this number will vary depending on VENDOR.

       REVISION=num
               the X protocol minor version supported  by  this  server  (cur‐
               rently 0).

       VERSION=num
               the  X  protocol major version supported by this server (should
               always be 11).

       VENDOR="vendor"
               a string literal specifying the vendor of the server.

       VNDR_name
               the VENDOR name string turned into  a  legal  identifier.   For
               example, "MIT X Consortium" becomes VNDR_MIT_X_Consortium.

       EXT_name
               A  symbol  is  defined for each protocol extension supported by
               the server.  Each extension string name is turned into a  legal
               identifier.  For example, "X3D-PEX" becomes EXT_X3D_PEX.

       NUM_SCREENS=num
               the total number of screens.

       SCREEN_NUM=num
               the number of the current screen (from zero).

       BITS_PER_RGB=num
               the  number  of significant bits in an RGB color specification.
               This is the log base 2 of the number of distinct shades of each
               primary  that  the hardware can generate.  Note that it usually
               is not related to PLANES.

       CLASS=visualclass
               one of StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor,  PseudoColor,  True‐
               Color,  DirectColor.  This is the visual class of the root win‐
               dow.

       CLASS_visualclass=visualid
               the visual class of the root window in a form  you  can  #ifdef
               on.  The value is the numeric id of the visual.

       COLOR   defined only if CLASS is one of StaticColor, PseudoColor, True‐
               Color, or DirectColor.

       CLASS_visualclass_depth=num
               A symbol is defined for each visual supported for  the  screen.
               The  symbol includes the class of the visual and its depth; the
               value is the numeric id of the visual.  (If more than one  vis‐
               ual  has  the same class and depth, the numeric id of the first
               one reported by the server is used.)

       HEIGHT=num
               the height of the root window in pixels.

       WIDTH=num
               the width of the root window in pixels.

       PLANES=num
               the number of bit planes (the depth) of the root window.

       X_RESOLUTION=num
               the x resolution of the screen in pixels per meter.

       Y_RESOLUTION=num
               the y resolution of the screen in pixels per meter.

       SRVR_name, CLNT_name, VNDR_name, and EXT_name identifiers are formed by
       changing  all characters other than letters and digits into underscores
       (_).

       Lines that begin with an exclamation mark (!) are ignored  and  may  be
       used as comments.

       Note  that  since  xrdb can read from standard input, it can be used to

The

       the character with the number given in the -start option will be used.

       The  characters  are displayed in a grid of boxes, each large enough to
       hold any single character in the font.  Each character glyph  is  drawn
       using  the  PolyText16 request (used by the Xlib routine XDrawString16)
       or the XftDrawString32 routine, depending on whether  the  -fn  or  -fa
       option  was  given.   If  the -box option is given, a rectangle will be
       drawn around each character, showing where an ImageText16 request (used
       by the Xlib routine XDrawImageString16) would cause background color to
       be displayed.

       The origin of each glyph is normally set so that the character is drawn
       in  the  upper  left hand corner of the grid cell.  However, if a glyph
       has a negative left bearing or an unusually large ascent,  descent,  or
       right bearing (as is the case with cursor font), some character may not
       appear in their own grid cells.  The -center  option  may  be  used  to
       force all glyphs to be centered in their respective cells.

       All  the  characters in the font may not fit in the window at once.  To
       see the next page of glyphs, press the Next button at the  top  of  the

              when  the  rule  matches are identical. Terminating actions like

       iptables-xml does a mechanistic conversion to  a  very  expressive  xml
       format;  the  only semantic considerations are for -g and -j targets in
       order to discriminate between <call> <goto> and <nane-of-target> as  it
       helps  xml processing scripts if they can tell the difference between a
       target like SNAT and another chain.

       Some sample output is:

           <chain name="PREROUTING" policy="ACCEPT" packet-count="63436" byte-

x11perf
Many graphics benchmarks assume that the graphics  device  is  used  to
       display the output of a single fancy graphics application, and that the
       user gets his work done on some other device, like  a  terminal.   Such
       benchmarks  usually  measure  drawing  speed for lines, polygons, text,
       etc.

       Since workstations are not used as standalone graphics engines, but  as
       super-terminals, x11perf measures window management performance as well
       as traditional graphics performance.  x11perf includes  benchmarks  for
       the  time  it  takes to create and map windows (as when you start up an
       application); to map a pre-existing set of windows onto the screen  (as
       when  you  deiconify an application or pop up a menu); and to rearrange
       windows (as when you slosh windows to and fro trying to  find  the  one
       you want).

       x11perf  also measures graphics performance for operations not normally
       used in standalone graphics displays, but  are  nonetheless  used  fre‐
       quently  by X applications.  Such operations include CopyPlane (used to
       map bitmaps into pixels), scrolling (used in text windows), and various
       stipples and tiles (used for CAD and color half-toning, respectively).

       x11perf  should  be used to analyze particular strengths and weaknesses
       of servers, and is most useful to a server writer who wants to  analyze
       and  improve  a  server.   x11perf is meant to comprehensively exercise
       just about every X11 operation you can perform; it does not purport  to
       be  a  representative  sample  of  the operations that X11 applications
       actually use.  While it can be used as a benchmark, it was written  and
       is intended as a performance testing tool.

       As such, x11perf DOES NOT whittle down measurements to a single ``HeXS‐
       tones'' or ``MeXops'' number.  We consider such numbers to be  uninfor‐
       mative  at  best  and misleading at worst.  Some servers which are very
       fast for certain applications can be very slow for others.   No  single
       number  or small set of numbers are sufficient to characterize how an

c2ph
It was a perl
       program that tried to parse out C structures and display their member
       offsets for you.  This was especially useful for people looking at
       binary dumps or poking around the kernel.

       Pstruct was not a pretty program.  Neither was it particularly robust.
       The problem, you see, was that the C compiler was much better at
       parsing C than I could ever hope to be.

       So I got smart:  I decided to be lazy and let the C compiler parse the
       C, which would spit out debugger stabs for me to read.  These were much
       easier to parse.  It's still not a pretty program, but at least it's
       more robust.

       Pstruct takes any .c or .h files, or preferably .s ones, since that's
       the format it is going to massage them into anyway, and spits out
       listings like this:

perl
Perl was originally a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text
       files, extracting information from those text files, and printing
       reports based on that information.  It quickly became a good language
       for many system management tasks. Over the years, Perl has grown into a
       general-purpose programming language. It's widely used for everything
       from quick "one-liners" to full-scale application development.

       The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
       complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).  It combines
       (in the author's opinion, anyway) some of the best features of sed,
       awk, and sh, making it familiar and easy to use for Unix users to whip
       up quick solutions to annoying problems.  Its general-purpose
       programming facilities support procedural, functional, and object-
       oriented programming paradigms, making Perl a comfortable language for
       the long haul on major projects, whatever your bent.

       Perl's roots in text processing haven't been forgotten over the years.
       It still boasts some of the most powerful regular expressions to be
       found anywhere, and its support for Unicode text is world-class.  It
       handles all kinds of structured text, too, through an extensive
       collection of extensions.  Those libraries, collected in the CPAN,
       provide ready-made solutions to an astounding array of problems.  When
       they haven't set the standard themselves, they steal from the best --
       just like Perl itself.

       GTK+ can use the cache files created by gtk-update-icon-cache to avoid
       a lot of system call and disk seek overhead when the application
       starts. Since the format of the cache files allows them to be mmaped
