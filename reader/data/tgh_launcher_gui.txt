Their pri‐

       Notice  that  all the magic is done by the underlying library, libgksu.
       Also notice that the library will decide if it should use su or sudo as
       backend  using the /apps/gksu/sudo-mode gconf key, if you call the gksu
       command. You can force the backend by using the gksudo command,  or  by
       using the --sudo-mode and --su-mode options.

       If  no  command  is given, the gksu program will display a small window
       that allows you to type in a command to be run, and to select what user
       the  program should be run as. The other options are disregarded, right

When

       status.

       time determines which information to display about the resources used
       by the COMMAND from the string FORMAT.  If no format is specified on
       the command line, but the TIME environment variable is set, its value
       is used as the format.  Otherwise, a default format built into time is
       used.

       Options to time must appear on the command line before COMMAND.
       Anything on the command line after COMMAND is passed as arguments to
       COMMAND.
